The tests explore how well students can solve complex problems, think critically and communicate effectively. This gives insights into how well education systems are preparing students for real life challenges and future success. Australia participated for the first time in PISA in 2000. By comparing results internationally, policy makers and educators in Australia can learn from other countries’ policies and practices.","keywordLabel":"","fullToc":[{"bookId":"1ccc35b9","homeId":"chapter-d1e9","title":"Albania","titleUrl":"Albania","toc":[{"type":"toctitle","id":"toctitle","content":[{"value":"Table of contents"}]},{"type":"level","id":"d2e13","level":"1","content":[{"type":"toc-entry","id":"d2e14","ctype":"section","refid":"section-d1e17","pagerefid":"chapter-d1e9","content":[{"value":"How well did 15-year-old students in Albania do on the test?"}]},{"type":"level","id":"d2e16","level":"2","content":[{"type":"toc-entry","id":"d2e17","ctype":"section","refid":"section-d1e29","pagerefid":"chapter-d1e9","content":[{"value":"Trends in mathematics, reading and science performance"}]},{"type":"level","id":"d2e19","level":"3","content":[{"type":"toc-entry","id":"d2e20","ctype":"figure","refid":"figure-d1e41","pagerefid":"chapter-d1e9","numbering":"Figure 1.
