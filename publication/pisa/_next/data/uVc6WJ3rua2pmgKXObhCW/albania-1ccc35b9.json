The tests explore how well students can solve complex problems, think critically and communicate effectively. This gives insights into how well education systems are preparing students for real life challenges and future success. Albania participated for the first time in PISA in 2001. By comparing results internationally, policy makers and educators in Albania can learn from other countries’ policies and practices.","keywordLabel":"","fullToc":[{"bookId":"1ccc35b9","homeId":"chapter-d1e9","title":"Albania","titleUrl":"Albania","toc":[{"type":"toctitle","id":"toctitle","content":[{"value":"Table of contents"}]},{"type":"level","id":"d2e13","level":"1","content":[{"type":"toc-entry","id":"d2e14","ctype":"section","refid":"section-d1e17","pagerefid":"chapter-d1e9","content":[{"value":"How well did 15-year-old students in Albania do on the test?"}]},{"type":"level","id":"d2e16","level":"2","content":[{"type":"toc-entry","id":"d2e17","ctype":"section","refid":"section-d1e29","pagerefid":"chapter-d1e9","content":[{"value":"Trends in mathematics, reading and science performance"}]},{"type":"level","id":"d2e19","level":"3","content":[{"type":"toc-entry","id":"d2e20","ctype":"figure","refid":"figure-d1e41","pagerefid":"chapter-d1e9","numbering":"Figure 1.

At the end of 2019, a strong earthquake hit Albania, causing important damages to infrastructure, including schools and houses, across 12 main cities. About half of the students participating in PISA 2022 (50.5%) are originally from the cities most hit by the earthquake. Until April 2022, when PISA was conducted, these students have been studying outside of their regular schools, with shifts and reduced teaching hours. The Covid-19 pandemic added to the challenges faced by the education system in Albania in 2020 and 2021: the state of the digital infrastructure posed great difficulties to the effective use of online and distance learning.
