                  </h1>
                  <p class=""><a id="p-d1e172" class="web_offset"></a>Finding a good job is critical to improve an individual’s overall socio-economic status, but Indigenous Australians face a number of barriers to employment. Indigenous Australians had labour market participation rates 19.9 percentage points lower than the non-Indigenous population in 2016 (57.1% versus 77.0%). The unemployment rate of Indigenous Australians was 18.4%—almost three times higher than the non-Indigenous Australian unemployment rate of 6.8% in 2016.
                  </p>
                  <p class=""><a id="p-d1e176" class="web_offset"></a>Through targets established under <em class="web_ita">Closing the Gap</em>, the Australian Government aimed to halve the gap in the employment rate between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians by 2018. Recent data show that this target has not been achieved and in fact, the gap has increased to 25.2% since 2006. A new draft target will aim for 60% of Indigenous Australians aged 25-64 years to be employed by 2028 – it was 46.6% in 2016. 
                  </p>
                  <p class=""><a id="p-d1e183" class="web_offset"></a>Innovative ways of working with Indigenous Australians are needed to improve their employment prospects, especially as many work in jobs that are most likely to be impacted by digitalisation and automation in the future. Australia’s network of employment services, <em class="web_ita">jobactive,</em> aims to connect jobseekers, including Indigenous Australians with employers. Indigenous Australians represented 9.5% of the overall <em class="web_ita">jobactive</em> caseload in 2015, whereas in the first quarter of 2019, this has increased to 11.5%. The Indigenous caseload has been rising as non-Indigenous job seekers are leaving the caseload quicker than Indigenous job seekers.
                  </p>
                  <p class=""><a id="p-d1e193" class="web_offset"></a>The OECD consulted with a number of local employment and training organisations in the cities of Sydney, New South Wales, and Perth, Western Australia to gain insights into the delivery of employment and skills programmes to Indigenous Australians. A key principle emerging from this case study work is that programmes achieve the best outcomes when they are Indigenous-led and Indigenous centred. This means having culturally competent front-line staff who are either Indigenous or have the relevant capacity and training to assist Indigenous Australians achieve their employment aspirations. While placing people into a job is critical, it is also fundamental to ensure Indigenous Australians have stronger access to pre-employment supports, such as literacy and basic skills training as well as mentoring to prepare for the labour market. Local partnerships between levels of government (e.g. Commonwealth, State, and Territory) and Indigenous Australians can embed community ownership into the delivery of programmes and services. Going forward, the government should consider the following recommendations to improve outcomes for Indigenous Australians.

While more Indigenous Australians are participating in training, the gap in educational attainment between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians is 12 percentage points at the diploma level or higher. The Australian Government should continue to encourage employment and training providers to set-up outcomes-based partnerships that deliver skills development programmes which lead to higher-level accredited qualifications for Indigenous Australians.
