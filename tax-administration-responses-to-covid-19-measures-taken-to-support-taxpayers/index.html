Measures for individual taxpayers generally focus on preventing hardship and reducing burdens given the restrictions in place in a number of countries. Measures for businesses, both legal entities and the self-employed, generally focus on helping to alleviate cash-flow problems to help avoid escalating problems such as the laying off workers, temporary inability to pay suppliers and, in the worst cases, closure or bankruptcy. </p><p id="p-d1e58" class="">This document contains examples of measures undertaken by tax administrations globally. The aim is to help administrations in considering domestic measures, and in validating measures taken through comparisons with what other administrations have done. It will be updated over time as a “living document” as more information becomes available. While some of the measures described in this document are within the general powers given to tax administrations, including powers which require special circumstances to be triggered, other measures may require legislative changes. This will, of course, depend on the circumstances in each country.</p><p id="p-d1e61" class="">The examples contained in this document are grouped under the following headings. (Further categories or sub-categories may be added to over time as more examples are provided.) </p><ul><li><p id="p-d1e65"><strong>Additional time for dealing with tax affairs</strong>, including consideration of:</p><ul><li><p id="p-d1e74">Extension of filing and tax payment deadlines</p></li><li><p id="p-d1e81">Remitting penalties and interest</p></li><li><p id="p-d1e88">Deferral of tax payments</p></li><li><p id="p-d1e95">Easier access to debt payment plans and extension of plan duration </p></li><li><p id="p-d1e102">Suspension of debt recovery </p></li></ul></li><li><p id="p-d1e109"><strong>Quicker refunds to taxpayers </strong></p></li><li><p id="p-d1e117"><strong>Temporary changes in audit policy and ways to provide quicker tax certainty</strong></p></li><li><p id="p-d1e125"><strong>Enhanced taxpayers services and communication initiatives</strong></p></li></ul></div><div class="web_section"><a id="section-d1e133" class="web_offset"></a><h2 class="web_h2"><span class="web_headline-link web_copyHeadingLink" data-customLabel="copyHeadingLink" id="copy-section-d1e133"><i class="fa fa-link"></i><span class="web_tooltiptext">copy the link</span><span class="web_tooltiptextcopied">link copied!</span></span>Design considerations</h2><p id="p-d1e140" class="">When designing these measures, tax administrations will need to consider a number of issues, including:</p><ul><li><p id="p-d1e144"><strong>Whether they adopt a targeted approach and only apply measures to taxpayers that are the most affected by COVID-19</strong>. This might be measures for particular sectors which are hardest hit or which are most crucial to helping mitigate the impacts of the crisis. Or it may be for particular taxpayer segments such as sub-sets of the self-employed or small businesses which, in relative terms, may suffer the most from cash-flow issues or from reporting burdens during this period. More targeted response, which may of course be in addition to responses targeted on particular sets of taxpayers, would be to provide support to taxpayers who can actively demonstrate that their difficulties are related to COVID-19. In these latter cases tax administrations may wish to consider how best to provide clear criteria and requirements for evidence to reduce burdens and stresses on both taxpayers and the tax administration.  </p></li><li><p id="p-d1e153"><strong>Whether to apply measures to all taxpayers, or all taxpayers within particular segments such as individuals, self-employed, SMEs and large businesses</strong>. Such an approach can be simpler to operate in that it applies in all cases (or in all cases within a broad taxpayer segment) and might be easier to communicate. It may not, though, deliver as effectively as targeted approaches to those in most need of support (although of course additional support may come from other government policies).</p></li><li><p id="p-d1e162"><strong>The consequences which might arise for taxpayers from tax administration actions.</strong> For example, decisions to defer tax reporting may have impacts on refunds depending on the system in place in a particular country. As a result taxpayers may see their cash-flow problems increase rather than being alleviated in cases where there has been over-withholding of tax or more advance payments made than the end liability and thus refunds are due. In addition, in some countries there may be a link between income as reported in tax returns and eligibility for benefits or for loan applications.</p></li><li><p id="p-d1e171"><strong>The duration of measures.</strong> On the one hand short term measures may not provide the extent of certainty that some taxpayers would like to see as regards cash-flow issues given their own views about the duration or severity of the crisis. Longer term measures may, though, store up problems for the future making it more difficult for taxpayers to return to normal conditions if, for example, debts build up to unsustainable levels or deferred payments lead to severe cash-flow problems at a later date (potentially causing system wide business liquidity issues at a later time).</p></li><li><p id="p-d1e180"><strong>The possibility of fraud.</strong> Some measures may be particularly vulnerable to fraud, for example where someone sets up a new company with fictitious staff and seeks government support; where someone seeks to dispose of assets before debts can be collected; or where deferred payments (such as payroll taxes or VAT) are siphoned off in fraudulent schemes. New risk measures may need to be introduced depending on the design of support measures. In addition, it is possible that the frequent scam approaches that are now seen (with scammers asking for account details or attempting identify fraud) may also rise in the coming period as the number of different communications with taxpayers and citizens increases in an inevitably more confused environment.</p></li><li><p id="p-d1e189"><strong>How to make options available to the digitally challenged.</strong> Many tax administrations now have extensive online options available and uptake is increasing among many taxpayer segments. Some taxpayers, though, may face digital challenges (for example because of age, location or other reasons). Tax administrations may wish to consider how the measures that they are taking can be best communicated to taxpayers in those situations and how they can be most easily taken up, for example through use of the telephone, fax machines, post or through communication by family members etc.</p></li></ul><p id="p-d1e198" class="">One further aspect to consider is the scope for tax administrations to support the broader government response to this crisis. For example, this could be through providing other forms of assistance to businesses and individuals on behalf of other agencies or central government or by providing direct assistance to the health authorities or emergency services. While not described in more detail in this note, the broader supporting measures could include:</p><ul><li><p id="p-d1e202">The use of tax administration channels to provide emergency government support, such as supplementing wages or salaries where businesses have had to temporarily cease trading during the pandemic;</p></li><li><p id="p-d1e209">The redeployment of resources to support health authorities and / or emergency services as well as to support Customs authorities in the clearance of medical supplies;</p></li><li><p id="p-d1e216">The use of the tax administration’s extensive databases of contact details (telephone numbers, email addresses etc.) to support wider government communication;</p></li><li><p id="p-d1e223">The use of tax administration expertise in data analytics, modelling, etc. to support health authorities in mapping relationships and disease spread patterns or other government policies.</p></li></ul></div><div class="web_section"><a id="section-d1e233" class="web_offset"></a><h2 class="web_h2"><span class="web_headline-link web_copyHeadingLink" data-customLabel="copyHeadingLink" id="copy-section-d1e233"><i class="fa fa-link"></i><span class="web_tooltiptext">copy the link</span><span class="web_tooltiptextcopied">link copied!</span></span>Measures to support taxpayers</h2><p id="p-d1e240" class="">To access the measures undertaken by tax administrations please click on one of the boxes below.</p><p id="p-d1e243" class=""></p><p id="p-d1e246" class=""></p><p id="p-d1e249" class=""></p><p id="p-d1e252" class=""></p><div class="web_section"><a id="section-d1e255" class="web_offset"></a><h3 class="web_h3">Additional time for dealing with tax affairs</h3><p id="p-d1e262" class="web_text-right">Back to overview</p><div class="web_section"><a id="section-d1e267" class="web_offset"></a><h4 class="web_h4">Extension of deadlines</h4><p id="p-d1e274" class="">In many countries, the COVID-19 outbreak falls within the period in which income tax return filing and payments are due. In addition, many taxpayers have to regularly file and pay employer withholding taxes (e.g. PAYE) and VAT or sales taxes. These deadlines could be pushed out by several weeks or months, to provide individuals and businesses impacted by COVID-19 with additional time to file their tax returns and related forms as well as to make tax payments. This could either be automatic or on request in a simplified format (e.g. email, phone). </p><p id="p-d1e277" class="">This may be particularly important where taxpayers require the assistance of intermediaries or specialised staff and systems to file returns. Remote working may make this impossible for some taxpayers, for example for system security and access reasons, and key staff may not always be available due to illness or caring responsibilities.  </p><p id="p-d1e280" class="">At the same time, there may be situations where tax return information is used to provide other government benefits. In such a scenario, the tax administration may consider retaining the return filing deadline (possibly except for specific cases) while extending the payment deadlines, or to allow the previous year’s tax return information to be used in these cases. This would allow the processing of benefit payments and provide taxpayers with additional liquidity. Further, the tax return information could be used to better understand the economic impact of COVID-19, to identify which sectors require additional assistance and to see when the economy is starting to recover.</p></div><div class="web_section"><a id="section-d1e283" class="web_offset"></a><h4 class="web_h4">Country measures</h4><div class="web_section"><a id="section-d1e290" class="web_offset"></a><h4 class="web_h5">Albania</h4><p id="p-d1e297" class="">The deadlines for the submission of financial statements has been extended.

The ATO is also encouraging clients to continue meeting their lodgement obligations to ensure business records are maintained. Visibility of lodgement also helps the administration to determine any support and assistance taxpayers may require.</p><p id="p-d1e310" class="">Responses will be tailored to individual circumstances, to provide support and assistance to those who need it, while leaving everyone else to lodge and pay as normal. The majority of Australian businesses and individuals utilise the services of a registered agent and there is functionality in our flagship Online Services for Agents product which enables agents to request an agent-assessed lodgement deferral of up to four weeks. Payment deferrals are linked to lodgement deferrals in most cases.</p><p id="p-d1e313" class="">The ATO has increased communications and is encouraging taxpayers and tax agents who are experiencing difficulty in meeting lodgement or payment obligations, or who are concerned about new and ongoing debts, to contact the administration. The ATO has a range of existing tools and discretions available to help taxpayers who may be struggling and increased the number of staff available on phone lines to meet the additional demand.</p></div><div class="web_section"><a id="section-d1e316" class="web_offset"></a><h4 class="web_h5">Austria</h4><p id="p-d1e323" class="">The deadline for submitting the annual tax returns for the year 2019 for personal income tax, corporate income tax, VAT and the determination of income is extended to 31 August 2020.

Taxpayers are requested to make greater use of electronic means of interaction by filing tax returns online through the Public Virtual Space Web Platform, by making payments through internet banking or through the online platform Ghiseul.ro, as well as making information requests through the call centre, electronically (via e-mail) or by checking the information which is periodically updated on the NAFA website.</p><p id="p-d1e4588" class="">In order to increase voluntary compliance, NAFA specialists contacted large taxpayers (in respect of the amount of tax revenue declared) to ask what fiscal problems they are facing during this period. For example, those companies that account for 70% of the revenues collected by the General Directorate of the Large Taxpayers were contacted directly. Similar campaigns have been and will continue to be carried out throughout the country</p><p id="p-d1e4591" class="">There is a permanent dialogue between NAFA representatives and the largest taxpayers in Romania (about 150 large taxpayers), as well as with the representative employers' organisations in those economic sectors that are strongly affected by the current environment.
