Furthermore, several governments issued pledges to ‘build back better’ and adopted net-zero targets by mid-century, e.g. Ukraine (Neuweg and Michalak, 2022). Exploring the likely environmental implications of these stimulus and recovery measures is important to understand whether the significant sums allocated aligned with the aim of a green recovery and whether they set the stage to “build back better” after the crisis.

Almost USD 1.7 billion was allocated to measures with a mixed or negative environmental impact (Neuweg and Michalak, 2022).
