Georgia, with its mountainous landscape, hydropower is already a major contributor to the electricity generation mix, while in Azerbaijan, renewables remain negligible, reflecting the domestic fossil fuel sector. Non-energy material productivity remains low compared to OECD averages. At the same time, while material footprints are also much lower than OECD averages, they will likely rise as economic development in the region continues.
