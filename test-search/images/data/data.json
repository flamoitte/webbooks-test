            "text": "This policy brief discusses the role of testing for COVID-19 as part of any plan to lift confinement restrictions and prepare for a possible new wave of viral infections. If all confinement restrictions are lifted before a vaccine or effective treatments are developed without other measures to suppress new infections, the infection rate is expected to rebound rapidly. Crucially, quick suppression of infections requires testing more people to identify who is infected; tracking them to make sure they do not spread the disease further; and tracing with whom they have been in contact. This brief discusses how testing strategies can be used to achieve three main goals: 1) suppressing the resurgence of local outbreaks; 2) identifying people who have developed some form of immunity and can safely return to work; and 3) gaining intelligence on the evolution of the epidemic, including on when a threshold for herd immunity has been reached. The brief discusses what tests can be used for each goal, as well as practical implementation issues with testing strategies, including the opportunities and risks of using digital tools in this context."

The antibodies in the testing kit bind virus\u2019 antigens from the sample. Such tests would be quick to run (sometimes less than 15 minutes) and could be used at the point-of-care (no need for a lab). However, the complexity of identifying and producing the required antibodies for the kit means that development of the tests is long and very few of them have actually been developed and they still require to have their performance assessed (as of 8 April 2020, five viral antigen tests received a CE IVD"

For example, what type of data is being collected through these digital initiatives, with whom and how it is being shared, with what access and copy permissions, what algorithms are being used to analyse the data, with what robustness and validity, and what decisions are being taken based on these analyses. There is little to no clarity on these questions, notwithstanding numerous widely supported guidelines at international level for broad and inclusive oversight of digital tools with high potential for human rights abuse and violation. A digital approach to widespread use of TTT is likely to be a key part of a successful exit strategy, but for broad public trust, acceptance and use of such digital tools and data, the risks and benefits must be well understood and communicated to populations."
