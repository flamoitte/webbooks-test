At the same time, the expansion raises challenges for supervision. The recent strengthening of the supervisory framework, recommended in previous economic surveys, by granting the Superintendencia Financiera enhanced regulatory and supervisory powers over financial conglomerates is welcome.

The new deficit reduction path implies an additional fiscal space of 0.5% of GDP in 2019, decreasing by 0.1 ppts of GDP by year until 2024.

These plans would help to stabilise public debt/GDP around its current level of 50% of GDP and put it on declining path overtime (Figure 14). However, the debt trajectory is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates, economic growth or oil prices. The need to stabilise the public debt is justified by strong dependence on volatile revenues and exposure as emerging economy to global financial shocks. Recent increases in the debt imply also that Colombia has now fewer buffers for unexpected events. The literature tends to limit prudent debt levels to 30-50% of GDP in emerging economies (Fall et al., 2015[11]) or maximum debt limit of 55-60% according to IMF (2019[12]) .

The 2018 tax reform also reduced effective corporate tax burden by eliminating the presumptive income tax and introducing a tax credit on the VAT levied on investment. Lowering further the tax burden on enterprises would help raise productivity and create formal jobs by strengthening investment incentives (Arnold et al., 2011[19]).

However, coverage is low and inequitable, which has contributed to high old-age poverty compared to OECD and Latin American countries (Figure 26). Only one in three in retirement age receive a contributory pension. Most of existing pensions were granted under the transition regime of the 1993 law, with less demanding requirements than current ones in terms of contributory weeks. Under current requirments, access to contributory pensions is expected to be less than 20% of the old-aged (Bosch et al., 2015[35]). While over 75% of the highest income quintile contributes to the pension system, less than 5% of the lowest quintile is able to do so. In rural areas, only 10% of the elderly are covered.

Coverage in the non-contributory component of the system, Colombia Mayor, which provides subsidies to the poorest, has increased in recent years, helping to reduce poverty (DNP, 2016[36]). However, the average benefit under Colombia Mayor is about a tenth of the minimum wage, and well below the poverty line and that of most OECD countries. The fiscal cost of increasing coverage and the size of the programme would be moderate compared to the social impact (Bernal, et al., (2017[24]). Simulations undertaken for this survey show that the reform would reduce old-age poverty significantly (Table 6)."},{"name": "1/2/1/index.html#p-d1e6847","text": "There is also a need to reduce inequalities and improve coverage. The public contributory scheme is more generous with high-income earners, as replacement rates are higher, introducing unnecessary competition in the system and making it complex and unfair (Nieto Ramos and Farné, 2017[37]). This is partly driven by implicit pension subsidies in the public regime, as the government fills the gap when contributions fall short of outlays. This accounted to 2.1% of GDP in 2016 and 86% of it went to the richest 20% of the population (Table 7). Phasing out pension subsidies to the richest and aligning replacement rates between contributory regimes would make the system fairer and less complex."},{"name": "1/2/1/index.html#p-d1e6864","text": "The low coverage of the pension system reflects the widespread informality. Efforts to increase labour formality (see section below) are thus fundamental to expand coverage. The constitutional rule that the minimum pension be at least the minimum wage leads also to the exclusion of a large part of the population from the contributory system given the relatively high level of the minimum wage. Although it requires a difficult change to the Constitution, delinking the minimum pension from the minimum wage would allow increasing coverage. Another option is to give partial pensions to those reaching retirement age with insufficient contributions through BEPS, the programme for workers earning less than a minimum wage (Box 7). Pension coverage would increase if contributions made by those not finally eligible for pensions are mandatorily transferred to BEPS. Other measures to expand coverage and saved amounts in BEPS include making savings mandatory for micro entrepreneurs and seasonal or part-time workers. Finding ways to increase the BEPS subsidy, for example giving increasing subsidies depending on the saved amounts or giving a subsidy upon enrolment would make the programme more attractive. This would improve old-age income support."},{"name": "1/2/1/index.html#p-d1e6873","text": "The fiscal cost of the pension system is also high in relation to its coverage.

OECD pension systems achieve an average fiscal cost of 8% of GDP with almost universal coverage. The dependency ratio is projected to rise substantially, as the currently young population is ageing (Panel C), putting the long-run sustainability of the system at risk. Sustainability would be helped by establishing a higher minimum retirement age, tied to increases in life expectancy, as current retirement ages of 62/57 for men/women are below other OECD countries. Replacement rates are also generous by international standards. The maximum pension is 12 times the GDP per capita, very high compared to 3.2 in Argentina, 2.2 in Brazil, 1.95 in Greece or 1.3 in Spain.

A reform of the government transfer system would help (Radinger et al., 2018[38]) reduce fiscal asymmetries across regions and ensure more resources per student are channelled to the most vulnerable territories. Further financing could also come from reallocating resources from other spending programmes without impact on productivity or equity, such as agriculture or housing subsidies. This would allow increasing quality of education and expanding full-day schooling and the school meals plan. At the same time, there is a need to ensure that better educational outcomes is the main policy target and that reforms in the education area are pursued with that aim.

Colombia also emits substantial greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture, forestry and land use, and in this inventory accounted for 42,8% of greenhouse gas emissions.

Expanding coal-fired electricity generation is inconsistent with reaching the climate objectives of the Paris agreement, which requires coal-fired electricity generation to be phased out. Increasing the share of renewables instead, as recently announced by the government, would help Colombia to meet its commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% by 2030.

Good progress has been made in improving primary roads but significant gaps remain in other areas. Colombia has now a historic opportunity to explore new export opportunities beyond extractive activities, including agriculture or services. Realising Colombia’s potential and opportunities will require promoting competitiveness and productivity by reducing the scope of non-trade barriers, continuing to improve infrastructure and boosting competition in services, including logistics.

Overall, average household income would increase by 3.5%. The marked pro-poor feature of the tariff reduction is explained by the fact that lower income households spend more on traded goods as a share of their income. In addition, the higher tariffs are placed on key consumer goods, such as food and clothing, which represent a relatively larger share in the consumption basket of lower income families. This finding is in line with other studies indicating that phasing out tariffs on rice would lift 1.2 million Colombians out of poverty and a further 443000 out of extreme poverty (Perfetti et al., 2017[37]).

International experiences show that dealing successfully with the legacy of measures requires intensified public-private dialogue, in which the private sector can flag problems and contribute to the solution, and a strong technical team (Cadot, Malouche and Sáez, 2012[38]). Colombian legislation provides a good basis for the review of the legacy of measures, as it establishes that regulators must review their technical regulations every 5 years to decide whether regulations should remain in place or need an update. Mexico and Indonesia illustrate that an agenda to streamline existing non-tariff barriers can act as a powerful tool to implement reforms essential to strengthen the competitiveness of domestic firms.

International standards are increasingly pursued in Colombia, although this still rests on a discretionary regulatory framework. Consolidating explicitly the use of international standards in regulations would be desirable.

This lack of liquidity increases transaction costs for market participants, prevents participation of certain investor types and increases risks (namely, systemic and liquidity)."},{"name": "1/2/2/1/index.html#figure-d1e14167","text": "Few firms participate in the stock market"},{"name": "1/2/2/1/index.html#p-d1e14186","text": "Note: For Panel B, data until May 2018 are included."},{"name": "1/2/2/1/index.html#d1e14192","text": "Source: World Bank, World Development Indicators database; World Federation of Exchanges database."},{"name": "1/2/2/1/index.html#p-d1e14203","text": "Policy actions to facilitate the development of the equity market include simplifying requirements and reducing costs for SMEs. Several emerging economies, such as India, Thailand or Singapore have successfully created specific market segments for SMEs within their main exchanges, with less thight listing and disclosure requirements and lower costs (WEF, 2016[56]). Another option would be to eliminate the restriction for banks from participating in the equity market. Allowing them to participate as investors and intermediaries would help greatly to develop the market, given that banks have greater access to liquidity. Adequate controls and restrictions on their participation could mitigate risks associated with their expanded role in the markets (WEF, 2016[56]). Acknowledging the importance to bolster capital markets the authorities have just finalised a capital markets expert commission with the aim of examining policy options to boost and diversify financing sources beyond the traditional banking channel, including for SMEs. This is a promising step to promote and give further impetus to a policy agenda for the development of capital markets in Colombia."},{"name": "1/2/2/1/index.html#section-d1e14223","text": "Boosting financial inclusion"},{"name": "1/2/2/1/index.html#p-d1e14231","text": "There is also a large potential to increase financial development by extending banking services to a greater share of the population. Positives steps have recently been taken in that direction, such as the simplification of procedures for opening bank accounts. Yet, the lack of interoperability across financial institutions and instruments remains a key concern, as it implies high fees, which limit financial inclusion. Fostering, modernising and unifying the payments system should be a priority and there are ongoing efforts in that direction. The government has also prioritised the coverage of the banking network and the use of digital transactions. Mobile banking systems also present unused opportunities in this context, as most of the population, including those in low to medium income brackets, own a mobile phone (Fernández De Lis et al., 2014[57]). Moving in this direction, an enabling framework for mobile money has been established, allowing financial institutions, different to banks, to offer digital financial services."},{"name": "1/2/2/1/index.html#p-d1e14243","text": "Facilitating the transition from cash payments into bank or electronic payments would also foster financial development and help to reduce informality (Rogoff, 2016[58]). Policy options include banning cash for transactions above a certain threshold, as done recently by France, Spain, Italy, Mexico or Peru, or taxing cash transactions as opposed to transactions through banks or electronic platforms. South Korea illustrates the potential of using the tax system with that purpose, as it introduced a tax incentive for electronically traceable payments, which succeeded in reducing cash transactions, increased financial inclusion and tax revenues and reduced income inequality (Jae et al., 2017[59])."},{"name": "1/2/2/1/index.html#boxsection-d1e14263","text": "Recommendations for boosting exports

Employment grew at an average annual rate of 3% between 2008 and 2018. Thanks to Government efforts to fight against informality, the informal employment rate decreased substantially in the last decade. However, many jobs are still of relatively low quality, affecting well-being and productivity. More than half of employment is informal and many vulnerable groups, notably youth, ethnic minorities and women are out-of-work. A high share of the population lacks basic skills and the mismatch between the supply and demand of skills is widespread. Overcoming these challenges will require actions in several policy areas as indicated by the implementation of the OECD Jobs Strategy for Colombia developed in this chapter. Effective actions include lowering the costs of formalisation for workers and firms, enhancing enforcement, better training and labour intermediation, and a better functioning unemployment benefit system. Greater efforts to make the education and training system more responsive to labour market needs by improving relevance would help. In particular, enhancing an apprenticeship system linked to formal education and encouraging more work-based learning would improve quality employment opportunities. Better skills assessment and anticipation information as well as greater efforts to involve employers in the education and training system would also help. Policies to boost female employment, such as expanding opening hours of childcare centres and continued efforts towards a universal early education, are also needed to reduce gender gaps. Reforms to boost export performance and enhance productivity can help to support business growth and employment and lay the foundations for more and better quality jobs (Chapter 1).

However, experience has shown that employment protection needs to be used cautiously because it can hinder efficiency-enhancing labour mobility and possibly generate dual labour markets if there is a strong gap in the stringency of regulations for permanent versus other contracts (OECD, 2013[18]).

Instead of having to pay one month per year of service at the time of dismissal, employers are mandated to make an annual deposit equivalent to one month’s salary to a severance fund (an independent financial institution) on behalf of every employee. In addition, employers pay 12% of interest on the annual amount of severance pay into the employee’s severance account (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2018[22]).

By allowing workers to run down their personal savings accounts during periods of unemployment, workers internalise the cost of unemployment benefits, thus strengthening the incentives of the employed to prevent job loss and those of the unemployed to return to work quickly. This feature is particularly relevant in developing countries with a large informal sector where monitoring the behaviour of unemployed people is complicated (Sehnbruch and Carranza, 2015[25]).

In Colombia, moving towards effective governance, allowing the articulation of the system and establishing unified criteria for evaluation and financing is needed. A national system of quality and relevance assurance using unified criteria for all suppliers would help increase transparency and quality of the system.

Resilience: The indicator of labour market resilience measures the estimated average increase in the unemployment rate over the 3 years following a 1% decline in GDP. The indicator is obtained from estimating the following model: Ut+s-Ut-1=β0s+β1sdlnGDPVt+β2sdUt-1+β3sdlnGDPVt-1+β4sdUt-2+β5sdlnGDPVt-2+∑j=1sβ4jdlnGDPt+j+εt+s , where Ut is the unemployment rate, GDPVt is real GDP in period t and s indicates the number of periods after the GDP shock. The model is estimated separately for each country and each s, with the estimated β1s  denoting the impulse-response function of unemployment to a 1% increase in GDP. The average change in unemployment is computed as the average of β1s over the 3 years following a 1% reduction in GDP. Data refer to the period 2000-2016 for all countries. Labour productivity growth: Labour productivity is measured in per worker terms. Data refer to the period 2000-2016 for all countries except Colombia (2001-2016). Ability of productive firms to attract workers: The efficiency of labour re-allocation measures the elasticity of firm-level employment growth to lagged labour productivity. The baseline estimated equation is: ∆lnLi,j,c,t=∑c=126βcCclnLPi,j,c,t-1+θx'i,j,c,t-1+γjct+εijct , where ∆lnLi,j,t  denotes employment growth in firm i, industry j and country c; Cc are country dummies; lnLPi,j,c,t-1 is labour productivity in gross output terms; xi,j,t-1 are employment and age of the firm; and γjct  are industry-country-year fixed effects to control for unobserved time-varying country-industry specific determinants of employment growth. The country-specific βc parameters provide a measure of dynamic allocative efficiency. Data refer to the period 2003-13 for all countries except Portugal (2006-2008) and Hungary (2009-2013). To control for effects of the business cycle on the efficiency of labour re-allocation, over the sample period 2003-2013 the baseline specification is augmented with an interaction term of lagged labour productivity with a dummy variable taking the value 1 if the lagged change in the output gap is below 0. Countries omitted from the table do not have sufficient coverage of firms in the ORBIS dataset. Wage-productivity decoupling: The indicator of decoupling measures the percentage point difference between real median wage growth and labour productivity growth. Using the notation ∆% X to denote the per cent growth rate of X, macro-level decoupling is defined as follows: Decoupling≡∆% WmedPY-∆% Y/PYL, where Wmed denotes the nominal median wage, Y denotes nominal value added, PY denotes the value added price and L denotes hours worked. Data refer to the period 2000-2013 for all countries except Australia, Canada, France, Italy New Zealand, Poland, Spain and Sweden (2000-2012); Greece and Portugal (2004-2013 ); Israel (2001-2011); the Slovak Republic (2001-2012). Low skills adults: Data refer to 2012 for all countries except Chile, Greece, Israel, Lithuania, New Zealand, Slovenia, Turkey and Jakarta (Indonesia). Data for Belgium refer to Flanders; data for the United Kingdom are the weighted average (2/3 and 1/3) of the data for England and the Northern Ireland; data for Indonesia refer to Jakarta. Low-performing students in mathematics: Data for China refer to Beijing-Shanghai-Jiangsu-Guangdong. Argentina: Coverage is too small to guarantee comparability. Non-standard workers: Workers on temporary contracts and self-employed (own account) workers aged 15-64, excluding employers, student workers and apprentices. Regional disparities: Data refer to the Territorial Level 2 (TL2) classification except for Australia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (TL3), and to 2000 and 2016 except for Denmark (2007, 2016); Estonia, Chile, Israel., Mexico and Russia (2000, 2014); Spain (2002, 2014); Latvia and Lithuania (2000, 2015); Slovenia (2001, 2016); Turkey (2004, 2016); Brazil (2004, 2013); China (2008); Colombia (2001, 2014) and South Africa (2008, 2014)."},{"name": "1/2/2/2/index.html#d1e26457","text": "Sources: Panel A: Chapter 1 of the 2016 OECD Employment Outlook, Chapter 1 of the 2017 OECD Employment Outlook, Chapter 1 of the 2018 OECD Employment Outlook, OECD Employment Database, OECD Job Quality Database and OECD Income Distribution Database."},{"name": "1/2/2/2/index.html#d1e26463","text": "Panel B: Resilience: OECD calculations based on OECD Employment Outlook 2017, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/empl_outlook-2017-en; Labour productivity growth: OECD Economic Outlook database and WEO - IMF data; Wage-productivity decoupling: OECD calculations based on OECD National Accounts Database and OECD Earnings Database; Ability of productive firms to attract workers: OECD calculations based on the 2013 ORBIS vintage; Low-skilled adults: OECD (2016), Skills Matter: Further Results from the Survey of Adult Skills, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264258051-en; Low-performing students in mathematics: OECD (2016), PISA 2015 Results (Volume I): Excellence and Equity in Education, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264266490-en.
