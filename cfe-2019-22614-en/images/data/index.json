Replay utilised an innovative model, aiming to connect students with employers from the beginning of the course. Students were able to learn in the workplace and apply their theoretical knowledge immediately once hired. The model is accessible for participants with different levels of education because the course moves in vertical steps, allowing students to become comfortable with each module before progressing to the next. Their work placements mirror the classroom, with their responsibilities increasing as they obtain the knowledge required for each role. This allows employers to also create a healthy work environment for employees that enables career mobility opportunities for students and professional development within the organisation.

Since some participants struggle with lower literacy levels or find the classroom setting to be intimidating, the programme’s pedagogy focuses on oral teaching and incorporation of culturally relevant perspectives. Replay also extends course learning and support to the workplace through on the job training and mentorship. In groups of 10-15, students participate in a peer-mentoring cohort. These cohorts try to reduce barriers for students by allowing peers and more senior participants to relate to each other. Former participants stated that this was an important piece in making the programme more accessible. To ensure knowledge is applied appropriately to the workplace, staff assess one student per day at the end of the workday. A teacher comes in-person to a student’s employers to assess the student. Along with students’ progression through the course, Replay also monitors success through its employment placements. Currently, the programme places about 100 participants per year into jobs.

This means understanding the skills, attributes and desire of the jobseeker to work in a specific industry and matching these to local employers who are most likely to need additional labour, and having a strategy to “sell” the jobseeker to these employers.

For example, according to the case studies interviewed for this OECD study, it is best if the employment consultant (e.g. the individual who has direct contact with jobseekers) does not participate in reverse marketing. Instead, it is preferable if this role is allocated to a specialist reverse marketer who is one-step removed from the jobseeker.
