                     <p class=""><a id="p-d1e724" class="web_offset"></a>The Census is one of the most reliable statistical sources for information about Indigenous Australians. The 2016 Census counted 798 365 Indigenous Australians, an increase of 18% from the 2011 Census. Looking at the State and Territory level, New South Wales and Queensland had the highest number of people identifying as Indigenous. Both states accounted for 486,961 Indigenous Australians, which represents 60% of the overall Indigenous population. The share of a state’s population identifying as Indigenous varies widely across Australia. Only 0.9% of the Victoria population identify as Indigenous. While New South Wales and Queensland have the highest total number of Indigenous Australians, they make-up 3.4% and 4.6% of the overall state population respectively. The Northern Territory has the highest proportion, where 30.3% of the population identify as Indigenous (see Figure 1.1)<span class="web_bibref" id="d2e1333"> (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2016[1])</span>.  Due to its remote geography within Australia, many Indigenous communities face unique challenges in accessing basic government services and infrastructure in the Northern Territory. Various studies in Australia have found significant negative effects on education and employment opportunities related to living in rural and remote areas that might affect the populations living there<span class="web_bibref" id="d2e1336"> (Kalb et&nbsp;al., 2014[2])</span><span class="web_bibref" id="d2e1338"> (Gray and Hunter, 2005[3])</span><span class="web_bibref" id="d2e1340"> (Hunter, 2010[4])</span>.

                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e809" class="web_offset"></a>Indigenous Australians are generally younger. The median age of Indigenous Australians is 23 years old compared to 37 years for the rest of the Australian population (see Figure&nbsp;1.2) <span class="web_bibref" id="d2e1374">(Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2017[5])</span>. Indigenous Australians make-up a growing share of the labour force, particularly in younger age cohorts (e.g. 24 years or younger). Similar to other OECD countries, population statistics for the Indigenous population are based on self-identification. Indigenous Australians represented 3.3% of the total population in 2016, up from 3% in 2011, and 2.5% in 2006. The Australian Parliament found that more children of 'mixed-couples' identify as Indigenous, a major component of the increase. These individuals may equally well identify as non-Indigenous, or be identified as Indigenous <span class="web_bibref" id="d2e1377">(Parliament of Australia, Social Policy Group, 2019[6])</span>. However, it should be noted that it is difficult to say whether the broadening of the population is having a positive, negative, or neutral effect on the overall socio-economic status and educational outcomes of Indigenous Australians.

Previous OECD research conducted in Australia, Canada and New Zealand highlighted how early childhood education for Indigenous people is critical to establish a strong start and lay the foundation for future success <span class="web_bibref" id="d2e1415">(OECD, 2017[8])</span>.

                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e907" class="web_offset"></a>Data from the 2016 Census shows that more Indigenous Australians are participating in the education system. Between 2011 and 2016, seven percent more 15-18 year old Indigenous Australians have enrolled in secondary education, reflecting earlier entry in education. Fewer Indigenous Australians are also dropping out of school, with 19% of Indigenous Australians aged 25 to 64 years leaving school at Year 9 or below, a decrease of 11 percentage points compared to 2006. While these figures show an encouraging improvement, the share of early school leavers among Indigenous Australians remained higher than that of the overall population in 2016 (19% vs 7% for the overall population of the same age group). The gap in the share of early school leavers between urban and rural areas is 6 percentage points (18% vs. 24%) but rural areas have made significant improvements in the last decade. Between 2006 and 2016, Indigenous Australians also attained higher levels of education, in particular from Year 12 and above (see Figure&nbsp;1.3). The strongest increase was at Year 12 or equivalent, and at the certificate level, at seven and eight percentage points respectively. When looking at the lower end of the skills spectrum, the share of Indigenous Australians with education level at Year 8 or equivalent nearly halved over the ten-year period from 2006-2016.

While the share of people attaining advanced diploma and diploma qualifications is similar between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, non-Indigenous Australians have higher shares of graduate diploma and graduate certificate attainment (30% of people with non-school qualifications for non-Indigenous vs. 13% of people with non-school qualifications for Indigenous Australians). Looking at postgraduate degrees, 3% of Indigenous Australians having non-school qualifications have this level of educational attainment versus 10% for the non-Indigenous population having non-school qualifications. This demonstrates that while more Indigenous Australians are participating in education and training opportunities, there is a gap to be closed for higher-level skills attainment opportunities.

The Skills Council has streamlined governance arrangements, policy development and the oversight of the performance of the VET sector. As a result, the Australian Industry and Skills Committee was established to provide industry with a formal role in advising the Skills Council on policy directions and decision making in the national training system. Training packages are a key feature of Australia's national VET system. A training package is a set of nationally endorsed standards and qualifications for recognising and assessing peoples’ skills in a specific industry, industry sector or enterprise. The development of training packages follows a consultative approach, where industry are consulted on an ongoing basis to identify skills and training needs.

This Department works alongside the Department of Education who is responsible for national policies and programmes that help Australians access quality and affordable early child care and childhood education, school education, higher education, international education and research. These Departments are responsible for post-school education and training through three distinct, but closely interrelated, areas: 1) providing policy advice and support to the Minister, underpinned by research, analysis and evaluation; 2) national programme management; and 3) working relationships with States and Territories, industry, education and training providers, and other stakeholders. Recognising the importance of VET, there have been a number of reforms to the VET system in Australia since 1974 to make it more responsive to the needs of the labour market (see Box 1.1).

                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1390" class="web_offset"></a>States and Territories in Australia have an important role in managing vocational education and training. Each Australian State and Territory government has a training authority with the main responsibilities of planning and reporting on VET strategies; purchasing training on behalf of their government; administering Australian Apprenticeships and VET in schools; administering funding and financial incentives for VET within the state/territory; supporting training organisations, employers and the community on VET issues; accrediting courses and registering training providers within the Australian Quality Training Framework. About 4&nbsp;600 registered training organisations deliver VET in Australia through Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institutes, universities, secondary schools, private training providers, enterprises, industry organisations, community-based providers and other government organisations. Many States are pursuing their own Indigenous employment and skills strategies. For example, through its Aboriginal Affairs Strategy, New South Wales is targeting skills outcomes among the Indigenous population on its territory (see Box&nbsp;1.2).

Extensive consultations with Indigenous Australian communities, stakeholders and industry gave some 2&nbsp;700 people the opportunity to contribute to the taskforce’s work. OCHRE aims to support strong Aboriginal communities in which Indigenous people actively influence and participate fully in social, economic and cultural life. To achieve this, the plan aims to teach more Indigenous languages and culture to build people’s pride and identity; support more Indigenous students to stay at school; support more Indigenous young people to get fulfilling and sustainable jobs; grow local Indigenous leaders’ and communities’ capacity to drive their own solutions; focus on creating opportunities for economic empowerment; and make both government and communities more accountable for the money they spend.

Slightly less than half of the participants in training who were not employed before found a job after training completion (see Figure&nbsp;1.6). Training also contributed to improve the employment status for 59% of participants regardless of their previous employment situation. While non-Indigenous Australians performed better than Indigenous Australians on this indicator in 2016, the difference between the two groups was negligible in 2018, indicating that participation in training has a positive impact on narrowing employment gaps between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.

                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1619" class="web_offset"></a>The most common qualification obtained after participating in training for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians is Certificate level III (see Figure 1.7). The share of participants at this level is 35% for Indigenous and 40% for non-Indigenous men. It is 37% for Indigenous women relative to 34% for non-Indigenous. Looking at other qualifications, there is a significantly higher share of Indigenous Australians attaining lower level qualifications, such as Certificate level I and II while non-Indigenous Australians attain certificate IV and above. This is particularly imbalanced when considering gender characteristics within the Indigenous Australian population. In 2017, 12% of Indigenous women attained a “diploma or above” qualification compared to 4% for Indigenous men.

                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1628" class="web_offset"></a>In looking at the future demand for skills, the Department of Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business has produced employment projections by qualification level from 2018-2023. The Department estimates that jobs requiring a Bachelor degree of higher qualification will see the strongest growth, projected to be 10% or 400 000 jobs (see Figure 1.8). Employment growth within jobs requiring Certificate IV or III (including at least two years of on-the-job training) are expected to grow by 3.8%. Jobs requiring Certificate II or III are projected to see grow of 7.9%. These projections reflect an evolving labour market in Australia, where a premium is being placed on higher levels of skills.

                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1695" class="web_offset"></a>Within the VET system, apprenticeships combine both workplace and classroom-based learning. Apprenticeship and traineeship programme contribute to improving the skills and the outcomes of the overall workforce. The work-based training component in particular helps young people develop soft skills, such as communication skills, problem solving and conflict resolution <span class="web_bibref" id="d2e1831">(OECD/ILO, 2017[21])</span>. By providing skills relevant to the industry and labour market demands, apprenticeship and traineeship programmes can increase people’s employability and productivity, contributing more broadly to economic growth and prosperity <span class="web_bibref" id="d2e1834">(OECD, 2014[22])</span>. In Australia, apprenticeships can take anywhere between 3-4 years, whereas traineeships are generally a few months to a year. Apprenticeships tend to be more focused on employment outcomes within sectors, such as construction, automotive, and engineering. Traineeships tends to be focused in service-based sectors, such as hospitality, hairdressing, and beauty therapy.

                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1715" class="web_offset"></a>In 2018, there were 13 550 Indigenous Australian apprentices and trainees. The age distribution of participants in apprenticeships and traineeships reflects the younger age composition of Indigenous Australians. Forty three percent of female Indigenous Australian apprentices and trainees were 19 years or under, and 33% of male Indigenous Australian apprentices and trainees were also in this age group. Indigenous Australian men aged 20-44 years represent 43% of all Indigenous apprentices and trainees (see Figure 1.9),

The National Partnership on Skilling Australians Fund defines higher apprenticeships as a programme of structured on-the-job training with formal study, with the study component leading to the award of a VET qualification at the Australian Qualifications Framework level 5 (diploma) or level 6 (advanced diploma) <span class="web_bibref" id="d2e1878">(Australian Department of Education and Training, 2018[24])</span>. Some research has pointed to the potential for higher-level apprenticeships to build bridges between the VET and higher education sectors in Australia <span class="web_bibref" id="d2e1881">(NCVER, 2019[23])</span>. While the concept is still in its early stages of development in Australia and will need further evaluation, there is a clear opportunity to look at how to encourage Indigenous Australians to participate in this training pathway. The evidence in this chapter demonstrates that Indigenous Australians are increasingly participating in VET but primarily in lower level qualification programmes. While training is important in linking Indigenous Australians to a job, it is also necessary to look at how to increase access to higher skills development opportunities. This is especially important within the context of the future of work, where labour markets across the OECD are becoming increasingly polarised between high and low-skill jobs <span class="web_bibref" id="d2e1884">(OECD, 2019[25])</span>.

                     <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1891" class="web_offset"></a>This section of the chapter highlights some programmes principles that have emerged from local case studies developed to understand the implementation of national programmes and how service delivery organisations are working with Indigenous Australians in Sydney, New South Wales and Perth, Western Australia to match them to better quality jobs and improve their access to skills training.
                     </p>
                     <div class="web_section"><a id="section-d1e1895" class="web_offset"></a><h3 class="web_h3">Employer engagement in skills development opportunities is critical</h3>
                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1903" class="web_offset"></a>One key principle emerging from the case studies was the importance of reaching out to employers and having them take a leadership role in implementing training. From a service provider perspective, many of the case studies have designated employer outreach officers who are actively communicating and working with local employers to identify job opportunities for Indigenous Australians and arranging the necessary training. 
                        </p>
                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1907" class="web_offset"></a>Considering the role of employers, feedback from the case studies notes that it is critical for senior leadership within a firm to promote a vision of a work environment that embraces Indigenous values and diversity. As much as Indigenous Australians need to prepare for work through training programmes, employers should make efforts to ensure that their workplaces meets the needs of all employees. Feedback from the case studies suggests that there are still large gaps in employers’ knowledge about the integration of Indigenous members of staff. 
                        </p>
                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1911" class="web_offset"></a>In Perth, both the Wirrpanda Foundation and AtWork Australia are marking active efforts to engage local employers. For example, after identifying that many employers lacked sufficient cultural awareness training policies, the Wirrpanda Foundation initiated their consultancy services which works with local firms to develop Reconciliation Action Plans (RAPs). The goal of the RAPs is to discuss the ways in which employers can make their organisations more inclusive. They schedule regularly “breakfast meetings” with local companies to discuss new and emerging job opportunities in the community as well as key issues that these firms face when employing Indigenous job seekers.
                        </p>
                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1915" class="web_offset"></a>AtWork Australia prefers to focus on working with a small group of employers so that they can build sustainable relationships and trust. In interviews conducted for this study, AtWork Australia noted that some employers do not have clear and tangible ways for employed individuals to take on more responsibilities over time within their company. AtWork Australia actively works with local firms to provide mentoring opportunities to change mind-sets and perceptions around employing an Indigenous job seeker.

                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1935" class="web_offset"></a>Feedback gathered through case study work for this project has emphasised the importance of developing training programmes in areas of growing skills demand. Each case study noted the importance of ensuring Indigenous Australians participate in training programmes that will lead to a job. There is an opportunity to target skills training to sectors that have the potential to face skills shortages in the future, such as Health Care and Social Assistance.

                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1970" class="web_offset"></a>Similar to the principle of promoting employer leadership, a key takeaway from the case studies was ensuring that training is delivered in a manner that simulates a workplace setting. In many cases, Indigenous Australians may not have previous work experience therefore training is most successful when it provides employability skills in addition to occupational-specific training. 
                        </p>
                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1974" class="web_offset"></a>Looking at the local case studies, Replay’s training arm, the Australian Centre for Workplace Learning, delivers accredited, workplace-based, face-to-face classroom learning in an Indigenous friendly-environment. This is an essential part of the programme as having an accredited qualification supports employment after completing training. Replay utilised an innovative model, aiming to connect students with employers from the beginning of the course. Students were able to learn in the workplace and apply their theoretical knowledge immediately once hired. The model is accessible for participants with different levels of education because the course moves in vertical steps, allowing students to become comfortable with each module before progressing to the next. Their work placements mirror the classroom, with their responsibilities increasing as they obtain the knowledge required for each role. This allows employers to also create a healthy work environment for employees that enables career mobility opportunities for students and professional development within the organisation. By initiating relationships between employers and the participants from the start, each of the employer and indigenous employee can gradually learn about the strengths and weaknesses of the other. This allows the participants to identify early where they need further support while they are still connected to the programme’s resources.

                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1986" class="web_offset"></a>Mentorship opportunities constitute another important factor for a successful transition from training to work. All of the case studies had a strong focus on embedding mentoring into the delivery of training. Culturally appropriate mentoring programmes can be successful in attracting, training and placing Indigenous Australians into employment. Within an Indigenous community, there are likely to be leaders who can champion education and training opportunities. Furthermore, once individuals have completed a programme, they are often well-placed to act as a mentor and work with people entering the programme to advise them on the value of training. According to feedback from the case studies, any person undertaking a mentor role with an Indigenous employee should either be Indigenous or should undertake extensive training about Indigenous cultures, values and customs.

Replay positions itself as an inclusive organisation that seeks to create an approachable, considerate and empathic experience for all participants. To help achieve these goals, Replay has also sought to employ Indigenous Australians who have been through the programme. Since some participants struggle with lower literacy levels or find the classroom setting to be intimidating, the programme’s pedagogy focuses on oral teaching and incorporation of culturally relevant perspectives. Replay also extends course learning and support to the workplace through on the job training and mentorship. In groups of 10-15, students participate in a peer-mentoring cohort. These cohorts try to reduce barriers for students by allowing peers and more senior participants to relate to each other. Former participants stated that this was an important piece in making the programme more accessible. To ensure knowledge is applied appropriately to the workplace, staff assess one student per day at the end of the workday. A teacher comes in-person to a student’s employers to assess the student. Along with students’ progression through the course, Replay also monitors success through its employment placements. Currently, the programme places about 100 participants per year into jobs. One of Replay’s key partners is the University of Technology Sydney, where Replay’s programme provides a potential pathway for entrance into the university. The partnership was formed more than a year ago and more than 30 students have graduated with a diploma.

                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e2040" class="web_offset"></a>Indigenous Australians tend to be over-represented when looking at adults who have low levels of language, literacy, and numeracy proficiency. These are often foundation skills, which are essential in preparing people for work. There is often a positive relationship between higher proficiency and labour force participation and employment. Individuals with higher levels of proficiency in literacy, numeracy and problem solving in technology-rich environments have greater chances of participating in the labour market and of being employed, and less chance of being unemployed than individuals with lower levels of proficiency, on average. Looking at results from the OECD’s Survey of Adult Skills (e.g. PIAAC), some 82.3% of Australian respondents scoring at Level 4/5 in literacy are employed, while only 56.8% of those scoring at or below Level 1 are <span class="web_bibref" id="d2e1989">(OECD, 2016[28])</span>.

                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e2052" class="web_offset"></a>The case studies in Sydney and Perth consulted for this OECD study emphasised the importance of assessing a job seeker’s basic skills proficiency before focusing on placing them in employment. As an example, when a job seeker walks into AtWork Australia, the candidate is not always prepared for employment. Sometimes, they have other needs that have to be addressed to pivot them as an ideal candidate for work. As such, AtWork Australia provides a number of services to address the holistic needs of each programme participant. Firstly, the programme determines whether a participant needs assistance with any fundamental skills, such as literacy and numeracy. After an assessment, participants can access Indigenous literacy training and standard TAFE training if needed.

                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e2072" class="web_offset"></a>Lower levels of skills and workplace experience have led to persistent labour market disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations across many OECD countries <span class="web_bibref" id="d2e2004">(OECD, 2018[29])</span>. As shown in this chapter, building up those skills is fundamental to promoting greater success in obtaining and remaining in employment. There are some international examples in which Australia may wish to look for future policy opportunities. In Canada, there have also been strong efforts to promote Indigenous-led vocational and higher education institutions. Box&nbsp;1.5 provides more information of an Indigenous-led vocational education and training institution based in the province of Saskatchewan.

                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e2089" class="web_offset"></a>Another promising example can be found in the province of British Columbia. The Aboriginal Community-Based Training Partnerships Program (ACBTP) focuses on building partnerships between Indigenous communities and public post-secondary institutions to improve access to education and training <span class="web_bibref" id="d2e2012">(Government of British Columbia, 2017[30])</span>. ACBTP is funded by the Province of British Columbia and the Government of Canada and is managed by the B.C. Ministry of Advanced Education. Application for programme funding must be jointly submitted by a public post-secondary institution and an Indigenous community. All programme participants must be Indigenous.

                              <p class=""><a id="p-d1e2123" class="web_offset"></a>Established in 1976, the Saskatchewan Indian Institute of Technologies (SIIT) is one of the four Saskatchewan educational institutions with credit granting authority. First Nations leaders and representatives from across the Province govern the Institute. SIIT offers certificate and diploma programmes in the trades and industrial areas, business and technology, health and community studies, and adult basic education to over 2 400 students annually. Programming is delivered through three principal campuses in Regina, Saskatoon and Prince Albert, plus eight Career Centres and a number of learning centres located throughout the province. SIIT also operates the Saskatchewan Aviation Learning Centre at the Saskatoon airport. SIIT strives to be the institute of choice for First Nations learners. Approximately 93% of current students are indigenous, First Nations, Metis or Non-Status Indian. SIIT is also committed to building and maintaining strong relationships and partnerships involving a growing range of provincial and national industry leaders, professional associations and academic institutions.

                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e2146" class="web_offset"></a>The world of work is changing and new technologies have the potential to further exacerbate disadvantaged people in the labour market. This requires strong efforts to work closely with Indigenous communities to promote skills development programmes, which provide digital literacy training and ensure Indigenous people have continuous opportunities to update their skills. 
                        </p>
                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e2150" class="web_offset"></a>As an example, the Joint Economic Development Initiative (JEDI) is an Indigenous organisation dedicated to working with partners to foster Indigenous economic development in New Brunswick, Canada. Founded in 1995 as a tripartite partnership between local Indigenous communities, the Government of Canada and the Government of New Brunswick, JEDI provides a variety of programmes and services to support workforce development of Indigenous People in New Brunswick. These include among others the Indigenous Adult Learning &amp; Literacy (IALL) programme, which aims to link Indigenous People to opportunities to obtain their General Equivalency Diploma (GED), master workplace essential skills and enhance computer skills<span class="web_bibref" id="d2e2035"> (Joint Economic Development Initiative, 2017[32])</span>. JEDI builds capacity within First Nations communities by offering two Train-the-Trainer programmes, Workplace Essential Skills and Digital Literacy, with the goal of establishing Community Adult Learning &amp; Digital Literacy Labs. The Labs help ensure that there is better access to learning opportunities for Indigenous People in New Brunswick. They are being designed to create a safe learning environment where learners can become work-ready by learning or enhancing their essential skills, literacy, technological skills and soft skills.

                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e2170" class="web_offset"></a>Increasing access to and completion of higher education among Indigenous youth is a priority across many OECD countries. Nevertheless, Indigenous people continue to fall behind when it comes to higher educational attainment rates. For instance, when looking at the share of the population with a postsecondary education, gaps in outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations can be seen in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States <span class="web_bibref" id="d2e2044">(OECD, 2018[29])</span>. 
                        </p>
                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e2182" class="web_offset"></a>There are some promising examples that could inform policy development in Australia. In New Zealand, the Te Kāhui Amokura was formed in 2004 aiming to promote the collective interests of New Zealand’s universities in improving outcomes for Māori students (“tauira”). It brings together the Deputy Vice-Chancellor Māori, Assistant Vice-Chancellor Māori or Pro-Vice Chancellor Māori from the eight universities in New Zealand. The Te Kāhui Amokura Strategic Work Plan endorsed in 2015 identifies key priority areas for improving outcomes for Māori and Pacific Islanders. It also presents good practice examples of initiatives being taken by universities in New Zealand targeting Māori students. These include the Tuākana Learning Community programme <span class="web_bibref" id="d2e2049">(Te Kāhui Amokura, 2018[33])</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e2194" class="web_offset"></a>Developed by the University of Auckland, the Tuākana Learning Community programme aims to enhance academic success of Māori and Pacific Islander students attending the university. Funded through the Tertiary Education Commission Equity Funding, managed by the University Equity Office, the programme is based on the principles of the <em class="web_ita">Tuākana-Teina</em> relationship model, an integral part of the Māori society. It is a buddy system where an older or more experienced person (Tuākana) helps and guides a younger, less experienced, one (Teina). The Tuākana are highly visible role models selected by their faculty, paid to be mentors and tutors. They are also supported through trainings and orientation. Most faculties within the university offer small group learning, seminars and academic learning skills workshops. The university makes considerable efforts to reach out to first year Māori students to provide them with a first point of contact. This liaison enables them to quickly access a support network. 
                        </p>
                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e2201" class="web_offset"></a>The University of Auckland has also introduced a new initiative in 2017, within the Faculty of Science, where research programmers and the computer science department have developed a mobile App assisting Māori and Pacific Islander students access up-to-date information, including on tutorial times, news and events. The programme has been successful in delivering positive outcomes for Māori and Pacific Islander students within the university, including increased retention (from 69% to 85% in 2010) and post-graduate participation rates (from 15% in 2005 to 17% in 2010). 
                        </p>
                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e2205" class="web_offset"></a>Among the key success factors of the programme, the university stresses the high quality of training for mentors, as well as its focus on ensuring that both mentors and students benefit from their involvement in the programme. Programme flexibility has also allowed faculties to take a different approach based on their specific needs. A Tuākana database allows faculty co-ordinators to access historical data to support analysis and communication. Finally, a model where faculty financing is based on achievement and evaluation reports helps the accountability and financial sustainability of the programme.
                        </p>
                        <p class=""><a id="p-d1e2209" class="web_offset"></a>Lastly, in Mexico, around 10% of the population reports themselves as Indigenous, and among these, around half speak one of the 62 Indigenous languages. Indigenous students perform historically below the average in Mexico. Indigenous participation and outcomes are also generally relatively low in tertiary education.  To address this underrepresentation of Indigenous Peoples in tertiary education, new higher education institutions have been established to foster more networks between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students (see Box&nbsp;1.6 for an example).

Inter-cultural universities in Mexico have a quota for enrolment: about 70% of the student body is composed of Indigenous Peoples and at least 20% comes from a mestizo (or mixed) background. These institutions integrate basic principles of the local Indigenous communities skills to compose classroom content and pedagogy, including Indigenous “philosophies, cultures, languages and histories”.
