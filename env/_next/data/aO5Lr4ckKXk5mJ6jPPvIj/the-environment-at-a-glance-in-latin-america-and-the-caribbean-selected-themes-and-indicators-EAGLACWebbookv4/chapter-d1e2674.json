It therefore excludes taxes and fees that are only partially correlated with energy use or GHG emissions. Common examples of policy instruments that fall outside the scope of the database include vehicle purchase taxes, registration or circulation taxes, and taxes that are directly levied on non-GHG emissions, such as the Danish tax on SOx. Some countries also apply production taxes on the extraction or exploitation of energy resources (e.g., severance taxes on oil extraction). Since these supply-side measures are not directly linked to domestic energy use or emissions, the database does not cover them either. Similarly, the database does not include value added taxes (VAT) or sales taxes. As VAT in principle applies equally to a wide range of goods, they do not change the relative prices of products and services (i.e. they do not make carbon-intensive goods and services more expensive than cleaner alternatives)."}]}]},{"type":"section","id":"section-d1e3095","content":[{"type":"sectiontitle1","id":"heading-d1e3096","content":[{"value":"Population and GDP"}]},{"type":"paragraph","id":"p-d1e3107","align":"left","content":[{"type":"emphasis","id":"d1e2013","emph":"bold","content":[{"value":"Population: "}]},{"type":"emphasis","id":"d1e2015","color":"333333","content":[{"value":"Population is the de facto population in a country, area or region as of 1 July of the year indicated.
