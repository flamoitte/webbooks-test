On average, a natural disaster results in an increase in the fiscal deficit of 0.3% of GDP for upper‑middle‑income countries, 0.8% for lower‑middle‑income countries and 0.9% for low‑income countries. The main negative impact is concentrated in a drop in fiscal revenues as a result of the fall in GDP. For lower‑middle‑income and low‑income countries, this reduction in public revenues is equivalent to 0.8% and 1.1% of GDP, respectively. The size of the government’s reaction in the event of a disaster depends not only on the severity of the disaster but also on the government’s rate of compliance in meeting its liabilities – that is, its ability and willingness to meet or exceed its ex‑ante commitments to shoulder specific disaster‑related costs."}]},{"type":"paragraph","id":"p-d1e1309","align":"justify","content":[{"value":"The effects of fiscal deficits can be specifically harmful to economies with tight fiscal space and can leave long‑term scars on fiscal accounts.

Natural disasters, alongside poor economic performance, insufficient fiscal restraint and high financing costs in capital markets, are the main reasons for these high debt levels. The cost of debt service for these economies greatly reduces their fiscal space and undermines their ability to react to further shocks and to fund the necessary public services and public investment to drive their development process."}]},{"type":"paragraph","id":"p-d1e1315","align":"justify","content":[{"value":"Climate change and environmental degradation are generating a direct social and economic impact. Many countries in LAC are experiencing a fall in agricultural productivity and tourism, as well as climate‑driven migration and high reconstruction costs after natural disasters. In the Dominican Republic, the heavy rains of 2016 generated severe economic losses in crops such as plantain, cassava and sweet potato. During the hurricane season of 2017, an estimated loss of USD 52 million was recorded due to lower touristic activity. Natural disasters create a need to increase expenditure and thus have direct impacts on fiscal deficits and public revenues. On average, a natural disaster results in a reduction of public revenues equivalent to 0.8% and 1.1% of GDP, for lower middle‑income and low‑income countries respectively. In the case of the Caribbean, the annual cost of inaction to deal with the effects of sea level rise, is estimated to reach USD 22 billion per year by 2050 (10% of GDP) and USD 46 billion by 2100 (22% of GDP). In the case of Haiti and Puerto Rico, two of the three most affected countries in the world between 1999 and 2018, annual GDP losses reached 2.38% and 3.76%, respectively. If environmental degradation is not addressed soon, LAC governments will have to add the costs of climate change to those of social vulnerability. The link between the dependence on biodiversity and financial security has proved to be very close, and the cost of inaction could have unprecedented economic and social consequences."}]},{"type":"boxnote","id":"boxnote-d1e1318","content":[{"type":"paragraph","id":"p-d1e1318","content":[{"value":"Note: <!!Add the note here.
