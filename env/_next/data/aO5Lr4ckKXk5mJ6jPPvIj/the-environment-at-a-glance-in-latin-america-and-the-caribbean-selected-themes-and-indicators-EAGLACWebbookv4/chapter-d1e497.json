The supply structure, which may vary considerably among countries is dependent on final demands by industry, transport and the household sector, and is highly influenced by national energy policies and endowments in energy resources."}]}]}],"pagesInfo":[{"id":"foreword-d1e85","title":"Foreword"},{"id":"chapter-d1e104","title":"Executive Summary"},{"id":"chapter-d1e139","title":"Reader’s guide"},{"id":"chapter-d1e195","title":"Introduction"},{"id":"chapter-d1e497","title":"Climate Change mitigation"},{"id":"chapter-d1e998","title":"Climate change adaptation - Impacts and risks"},{"id":"chapter-d1e1552","title":"Air quality "},{"id":"chapter-d1e1968","title":"Biodiversity and ocean"},{"id":"chapter-d1e2367","title":"Environmental policy instruments"},{"id":"chapter-d1e2674","title":"Glossary"},{"id":"chapter-d1e3130","title":"Data sources"}],"lang":"en","sdgs":null,"keywordLabel":"","keywords":null,"countries":null,"regions":null,"otherLanguage":null,"relatedProduct":null,"relatedPublication":[],"relatedContent":[],"relatedWebsite":[],"toc":[{"type":"toctitle","id":"toctitle","content":[{"value":"Table of contents"}]},{"value":"Environment at a Glance Indicators: Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) provides interactive on-line access to the latest comparable LAC-country data on the environment.
