It was conceived as a mechanism to promote markets, mainly through tradable linked emission permits or projects inspired by the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) framework. The idea is that, under this mechanism, countries with the capacity to reduce emissions could sell their excess to those emitters whose abatement costs are higher, thus ensuring that the net reduction of emissions is at a lower total cost. Through this flexible mechanism, GHG emissions can be reduced at lower cost, along with stimulating innovative and cleaner technologies to drive an overall transition to a low-carbon economy in developing countries."}]}]}]},{"type":"paragraph","id":"p-d1e3673","align":"justify","content":[{"value":"Countries have increasingly adopted carbon pricing, but more needs to be done to reach "},{"type":"emphasis","id":"d2e2402","color":"212121","content":[{"value":"climate targets.
