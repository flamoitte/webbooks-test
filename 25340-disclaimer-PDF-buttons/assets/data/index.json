The government has responded to the revenue decline by instructing government ministries to cut their expenditure by 20-30%, but this did not happen quick enough to offset the revenue decline, and the quarterly budget fell into deficit amounting to around USD 9 billion. The country’s net foreign assets fell by USD 26.8 billion last month to reach USD 465.1 billion a nine-year low, likely reflecting the government’s need to use deposits to meet its payment obligations due to declining oil revenues and because the government has injected liquidity into the banking sector.
