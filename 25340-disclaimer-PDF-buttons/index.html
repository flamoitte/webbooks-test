                  ></a>Governments in the MENA region have rapidly reacted to contain the Coronavirus (COVID-19). With all necessary caution at this stage of pandemic, contagion seems limited so far, and the public health consequences less severe than expected. However, the pandemic is already causing dramatic economic (drop in oil revenues, remittances, FDIs and tourism) and social consequences, in particular for the most vulnerable (youth, women, informal workers). A regional agenda of reform could help address the region’ structural imbalances and support the design of a new inclusive growth model. </p>

                <p class=""><a id="p-d1e41" class="web_offset"
                    ></a>Governments from the MENA region have rapidly taken decisive measures to slow the increase of COVID-19 contagion by <strong>limiting the movements of hundreds of millions of people</strong>. There are over 320,000 confirmed cases across the MENA region, just under half (46%) of them in Iran. Among Arab economies, Saudi Arabia has the most confirmed cases, followed by Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. </p>
                <p class=""><a id="p-d1e47" class="web_offset"
                    ></a>Despite varying levels of health system preparedness across the region, MENA countries’ overall health management strategies, characterised by strict containment measures implemented in the very early stages of the outbreak, have proved <strong>efficient in limiting the spread of the pandemic in the region</strong>. As of May, countries are progressively and carefully starting to ease restrictions on movement and economic activities and prepare their <strong>strategy towards de-confinement</strong>. </p>
                <p class=""><a id="p-d1e56" class="web_offset"
                    ></a>The pandemic is challenging MENA economies’ ability to cope as the <strong>virus strains medical systems</strong>, some of which are particularly weak and overcrowded. The situation is, obviously, not the same for the richer Gulf countries, the developing economies in the Levant or North-Africa, or in fragile and conflict-affected countries such as Syria, Iraq, the Gaza Strip, Yemen and Libya, where the lack of hospital beds and testing capacities is a cause of concern. On the other hand, some countries have adopted <strong>rapid, decisive and/or innovative measures to contain the virus</strong>, such as virtual doctors and sanitising robots in the UAE, or ramping up domestic masks production in Morocco. This highlights significant differences between countries in terms of their capacity to react on the healthcare side.</p>
                <p class=""><a id="p-d1e65" class="web_offset"
                    ></a>The crisis is also testing the public sector, forcing governments to make quick decisions and implement drastic measures to protect communities at risk. <strong>Many administrations have shown a good capacity to mobilise</strong> and implement prevention measures, while preparing for stimulus packages. This crisis emphasizes the importance of underlying structural issues, such as the importance of transparency and the fight against corruption, effective public procurement, digitalisation and open government approaches, in addition to a strengthened role for civil society. Public governance measures should be used to ensure the continuity of response and essential services by public institutions but it should also enhance public sector resilience and adaptability while restoring the population’s trust in public institutions. It also sheds light on the need to build public sector capacity to withstand crisis and respond appropriately, which requires investment in capacities for coordination, prioritisation and agility. </p>
                <p class=""><a id="p-d1e71" class="web_offset"
                    ></a>The pandemic is already causing a <strong>dramatic economic cost</strong>, with both a negative demand/supply shock and a shock from the collapse of oil prices.<a
                    id="back-endnotea0z2" class="web_offset-inline"></a><a class="web_noteref"
                    href="#endnotea0z2"
                    >1</a> As countries have taken a series of containment measures limiting transportation and economic activity, these are strongly weighing on the ability of people to go to work and on businesses to continue contributing to the economy. At the same time, the region suffers from a drop in demand at the regional and at global levels, while most supply chains are disrupted. The effects of containment measures on the services sector, which employs a large number of people in the region, will cause wide reverberations if unemployment rises and wages and remittances fall. The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for West Asia estimates that the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic will cause an additional <strong>8.3 million people to fall into poverty</strong><a
                    id="back-endnotea0z3" class="web_offset-inline"></a><a class="web_noteref"
                    href="#endnotea0z3"
                  >2</a>. Further, <strong>bottoming crude oil prices</strong> have put additional strain on even the region’s wealthiest countries. The drop in prices may give MENA oil importers leeway to allocate additional funding to those sectors most affected by the crisis. However, also oil importing countries are negatively affected by the decline in oil prices, through reduced investments from Gulf countries, which are the largest investor in the region, as well as substantial lower remittances from Gulf countries and work opportunities in the richer GCC region for nationals of other MENA countries.</p>
                <p class=""><a id="p-d1e101" class="web_offset"
                    ></a>The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak may <strong>further exacerbate those regional differences and structural imbalances</strong>, in addition to continued political instability as well as fragility in some cases. The outbreak of the virus has indeed impacted political developments within MENA economies. In particular, demonstrations in Algeria and Lebanon, which had been ongoing since February and October 2019 respectively, have been put to a halt due to the sanitary crisis. On 8 April, Saudi Arabia announced a two-week ceasefire in the offensive on Yemen in light of the humanitarian crisis. </p>
                <p class=""><a id="p-d1e107" class="web_offset"
                    ></a>The crisis could, still, offer an opportunity to <strong>engage in a comprehensive reform agenda and address some of the region’s underlying structural issues</strong> (decentralisation, private sector development, social protection), design a new growth model (economic diversification, health and education spending, industrial innovation and participation in regional value chains), building on all segments of the society. Looking ahead, in a region with very heterogeneous situations for the capacity of the <strong>civil society</strong> to operate with autonomy<strong>,</strong> it will be important to monitor the impact of the pandemic on governance frameworks. Indeed, new laws and controls put in place to contain the pandemic may have long-term negative effects on the space in which the civil society operates. In a moment where the contribution of all to face the unprecedented economic and social challenges is more necessary than ever, empowering people remains a critical need.</p>

In line with the global trend, the reported numbers increased sharply in the first few weeks of the outbreak. However, infection and mortality rates as of May seem to indicate that <strong>the pandemic has not hit the region as hard as expected</strong>. Indeed, the number of COVID-19 related deaths in Arab countries, relatively to the population, remain far below the rates experienced in some European and Asian countries. </p>

                        ></a>This can be explained by MENA economies’ swift and early response. Following the outbreak of the pandemic, they introduced <strong>strict containment measures</strong> starting in the first half of March already. Notably, many countries did not wait to have confirmed cases to start imposing movement restrictions and social distancing measures. Saudi Arabia, for instance, suspended pilgrimages to Mecca and Medina and barred access to religious sites in the two cities as early as February 26. </p>
                    <p class=""><a id="p-d1e152" class="web_offset"
                        ></a>Most countries started by closing schools and nurseries, and prohibiting large public gatherings, including religious ones. Given the pandemic risk, several countries declared a <strong>state of national emergency</strong> and imposed stricter containment measures including mandatory self-isolation and curfews. All countries have banned entry to foreigners until further notice and air traffic has been put on hold or significantly reduced. Borders remain open for transport of goods and medical equipment. Quarantine rules were often accompanied by severe penalties for non-compliance, ranging from heavy fines to prison sentencing, such as in Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.  </p>

                        ></a>MENA economies seem to be building on the factors that contributed to the success of their containment strategies to approach the deconfinement phase. In all countries, <strong>the gradual easing of restrictions has been coupled with permanent strict preventive measures</strong>. Physical distancing continues to be enforced in most countries, with businesses required to comply with precautionary measures in order to be allowed to re-open. Face masks have also been made mandatory in public settings in Bahrain, Morocco, Qatar and the UAE, with violators facing heavy penalties including up to three months of jail in Morocco. </p>

In particular, <strong>several countries have increased the number of intensive care units</strong> and hospital beds available for COVID-19 patients, including by building dedicated treatment facilities as in the UAE, which performs more than 40,000 tests per day. Governments have also <strong>scaled up their testing capacity </strong>by opening new sites and establishing drive-through testing stations.

For example, the Tunisian government has created a National COVID-19 Monitoring Authority, gathering senior officials from all ministries, with the aim of “imposing full compliance with measures to fight the virus". The Authority will also ensure the coordination between the National Committee against the coronavirus, headed by the Presidency of the Government, and the regional committees against natural catastrophes. It will also be in charge of “monitoring the regularity of the supply of basic products, the distribution of social assistance to poor families or families without income, as well as the referral of recommendations to the national committee to combat COVID-19 to adopt the necessary measures to contain the virus".</p>

                      ></a>Finally, the <strong>public procurement</strong> systems of MENA countries adapted to the crisis by implementing measures to facilitate the timely procuring of critical and sanitary goods in keeping with the fast-evolving needs. For example, the Tunisian National Authority for Public Procurement (HAICOP) has published a circular to remind public buyers of the necessity to respect the established provisions for cases of force majeure and loosen public procurement procedures. Similarly, efforts are under way to build up the resilience of critical infrastructures, such as healthcare facilities and essential suppliers, to absorb the impact of the crisis in the short-term and encourage their durability and resistance to future crises in the longer term, where public governance responses will be essential in creating the conditions for economic and social recovery. They will be key in building a strong public sector that is coordinated, responsive, reliable, open, inclusive, transparent and accountable, and therefore able to constantly anticipate and efficiently respond to evolving needs and challenges that could arise from potential shocks in the future.</p>

They provided specific sectoral support and encouraged shifting production, notably in free zones, introduced fiscal and financial measures to release pressure on some industries and support contracted economic activities, expanded access to their local market to foreign investors (e.g. in Tunisia and Egypt). Investment promotion agencies (IPAs) are taking emergency actions to sustain and retain existing investment. They set up crisis units to inform and communicate with investors, to respond to their queries and to follow on production disruptions. They are refocusing, redesigning and reinforcing their aftercare services aiming at investment retention, in particular in strategic and essential sectors (e.g. aftercare now represents 70% of the activities of the Foreign Investment Promotion Agency of Tunisia which is solving punctual investors’ problems and encouraging redirection of production lines toward demanded products and services). </p>

The MENA region depends primarily on China and the EU for trade, with around 60% of North Africa’s trade with the EU28. The top four economies in the region that are particularly exposed to a disruption of China’s exports of intermediate inputs are: Morocco and Tunisia (in particular for electrical machinery), Saudi Arabia (chemicals), and the UAE (metal and metal products). Most MENA economies are experiencing wide decreases in imports and apply exports bans, in particular on food, medical and hygiene items. </p>

MENA countries are starting reflection on how to take into account the implications of such considerations and respond to the new possible configuration of value chains. For example, Tunisia is already working on its investment strategy for 2021. The strategy would focus on foreign investors re-shoring and near-shoring strategies to attract investors that are considering to relocate their production lines in order to shorten their supply chains (see upcoming OECD note on investment in the MENA region in the time of COVID-19).</p>

This was strengthened further by the G20 extraordinary ministerial meeting on 10 April, bringing together some of the world’s biggest producers, including the United States, Canada, Brazil and others to discuss concerted action to address the oil market overhang. The strength of the demand destruction, which reached an estimated 25.2 mb/d in April, has rendered any supply side action insufficient to rebalance the market immediately. However, as OPEC+ cuts came into force at the start of May, and clarity started to form over the market-based responses to lower prices in the United States in particular, there is expectation that due to lower supply and recovering demand (brought on by the relaxation of the COVID shutdowns), the market will turn from historically high levels of stock build to withdrawal. The voluntary nature of the agreement coupled with discounted Saudi crude to Asian markets (Reuters) did not deliver the reassurance the market needed to overcome this rout. </p>

                    ></a>For producer economies in the Middle East and North Africa, the lower oil prices have had an immediate impact on economic fortunes. For some, it has once again exposed the frailties of an economy too dependent on revenues from oil and gas. In Saudi Arabia, for example, oil revenue fell by 24% year-on-year in Q1. When one considers that the oil price was relatively resilient, and hovered above USD 50/b until around 5 March and that exports were elevated in March, going forward this initial decline augurs for a much steeper fall this quarter. The fall in non-oil revenue was of similar scale, reaching around 17% in Q1. The government has responded to the revenue decline by instructing government ministries to cut their expenditure by 20-30%, but this did not happen quick enough to offset the revenue decline, and the quarterly budget fell into deficit amounting to around USD 9 billion. The country’s net foreign assets fell by USD 26.8 billion last month to reach USD 465.1 billion a nine-year low, likely reflecting the government’s need to use deposits to meet its payment obligations due to declining oil revenues and because the government has injected liquidity into the banking sector. This was the largest fall in foreign assets in 20 years, and around 50% more than the steepest decline faced after the 2014 price crash.</p>
                  <p class=""><a id="p-d1e698" class="web_offset"
                    ></a>The decline in government spending may compound the economic malaise. In Saudi Arabia but also across the Gulf, the slowdown in economic activity is expected to hit expatriate labour hard, resulting in estimated population declines of between 4% and 10% across the region this year. In Iraq, one of the Middle East’s most oil dependent economies, the situation is grave. In April, oil export revenues fell to $1.4 billion (down from $6.1 billion in January), leaving a gap of around $4.1 billion to meet obligations for essential spending for salaries, pensions and the running of government offices. To compound the issue, without a significant increase in prices, revenues will likely fall even lower in May, as Iraq’s contribution of a 1 mb/d cut to output as part of the OPEC+ deal comes into force. The declining revenues have already caused visible strains, and has forced the new government to tap into its foreign reserves (estimated at around $67 billion) in order to meet its monthly salary obligation for May. </p>

Water scarcity and lack of access to clean water and sanitation as well as poor waste management (including on hazardous waste e.g. bio-medical and health-care waste) in MENA countries and especially in their less well-off segments of society, in conflict-affected territories and the refugee camps can accentuate the impact of pandemics. Furthermore, confinement measures can result in increased exposure to indoor air pollution, particularly for people relying on polluting fuels for cooking and heating in poorer MENA countries and for buildings lacking, or with poor, ventilation systems. </p>

                    ></a>As the crisis evolves around the world, MENA governments should ensure that their stimulus measures and policy responses are aligned with ambitious climate change and wider environmental protection goals.  They should systematically evaluate possible unintended negative environmental impacts of new short-term recovery measures (e.g. fiscal and tax provisions), ensure policy coherence and avoid creating perverse and unintended environmental consequences that might damage the future resilience and environmental health of societies.  </p>

                      ></a>Stimulus measures could be an opportunity in MENA to <strong>invest in the real economic transformations and technological innovations</strong> (avoiding greenwashing), such as boosting technologies for solar and wind energy, for smart green cities as well as for seawater desalinisation projects (powered by renewable energy sources) and developing and greening public transport systems. This could help the Gulf Cooperation Council countries reduce their carbon footprint and energy demand as well as diversify their economy from fossil fuels. Public and private support should be enhanced also for the investments in water and waste infrastructure development and modernisation, especially in poorer MENA countries. Enhanced levels of environmental health will strengthen the resilience of societies to pandemics and other emergencies.</p>

                      ></a>MENA governments should make sector-<strong>specific financial support measures conditional on environmental improvements</strong> where possible. The use of financial support measures such as preferential loans, loan guarantees and tax abatements could be directed towards supporting stronger environmental commitments and performance in pollution-intensive sectors that may be particularly affected by the crisis. Communication campaigns that underscore the benefits to well-being and prosperity from more resilient societies can strengthen public support for measures aimed at enhancing environmental health.</p>

                    ></a><strong>Pre-existing vulnerabilities in the region are likely to amplify the impact of the outbreak on businesses and households</strong>. Currently, the top 10% richest of the population owns 64% of the wealth, making the MENA region among the most unequal globally.<a

                    href="#endnotea0z32"
                  >31</a> Such inequalities are at risk of being exacerbated by the sanitary crisis, as vulnerable groups are disproportionately exposed to the pandemic and its socioeconomic impacts. Exposure and coping ability and mechanisms are directly affected by income levels of both households and regions. Informal or unsanitary housing, refugee camps and besieged areas have a significantly lower capacity to contain the spread of the virus and access health services. Poor households – a significant share of the MENA population - migrant workers and refugee populations face a stronger strain on their source of income, as they do not benefit from coping arrangements such as remote work or paid leave. This represents a lasting pressure on previously existing inequality patterns. Strong gender imbalances in the region also risk being exacerbated as a result of the crisis. </p>

                    ></a>MENA economies are characterised by a sharp dichotomy between a formal labour market and a precarious informal economy. Formal private employment is limited and accounts on average for less than a fifth of employment<a

                    href="#endnotea0z35"
                  >34</a>. Informality is generally associated with limited or lack of social protection coverage and low and unstable revenues, making informal workers particularly vulnerable in the face of a crisis. In MENA economies, informal workers are concentrated in low-productivity jobs requiring physical presence, with no possibility to work remotely. In the context of the COVID-19 crisis, the movement restrictions and confinement measures will thus put an even bigger strain on informal workers’ activity. Many of them face a dilemma between complying with the health measures and maintaining a source of income to pay for their food and other basic expenses.  </p>
                <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1049" class="web_offset"
                    ></a>At the same time, informal workers are not necessarily beneficiaries of support schemes put in place under this crisis, such as state support for wages. In the short run, countries with large informal sectors could develop ways to support the informal sector through, for example, direct cash transfers or other types of specific support. In the longer run, countries will need to address the root causes of informal activity, which include the lack of employment opportunities, fragile social security systems and weak enforcement. This is particularly important since the COVID-19 pandemic may unsettle or challenge the functioning of social safety nets. For example, Morocco implemented a transfer program for informal workers using mobile phones, and other countries could develop similar assistance programs<a

                <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1075" class="web_offset"
                  ></a>Due to regional-specific barriers related to unequal economic opportunities, access to financial services and markets, occupational and sectoral segregation in the labour market and perceptions regarding women’s role in the society, women’s job and income security is likely to be more exposed than men’s to the economic fallout from the crisis. These risks are particularly acute for certain categories of informal workers who lack job and income security, including domestic workers, agricultural workers, and refugees, among which women are over-represented. </p>

A large proportion of women in MENA countries work in the <strong>manufacturing sector</strong>, which is expected to be among the most severely hit by the crisis. Most women are employed in <strong>micro and small enterprises</strong>, which are less resilient in times of crises and more likely to resort to temporary suspension or termination of contracts to face the economic downturn. Women are also over-represented in part-time employment (up to 50% of employed women in Morocco and the Palestinian Authority hold part-time jobs), which makes them easier to lay-off. Overall, UN Women <a

While this trend has been observed globally, it may be particularly acute in the MENA region due to restrictive social norms that see men as heads of household and responsible for the family income. If the crisis prevents men from upholding this role due to income or job loss, resulting frustrations may be outed in the form of violence. Across the MENA region, NGOs and governments have noted an <a

                <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1119" class="web_offset"
                  ></a>Several MENA countries have taken steps to integrate the specific needs of women in the COVID-19 response. In Algeria and Tunisia, the Ministry of Women’s Affairs is actively involved, alongside other Ministries, in the committees in charge of elaborating the crisis response. In Egypt, the National Council for Women (NCW) has been working closely with the government to mainstream a gender equality perspective in the health, social protection and economic measures adopted to mitigate the impacts of the crisis. The NCW also launched a policy tracker to monitor the policy measures taken by the government to respond to women’s needs in the context of the outbreak. </p>
                <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1122" class="web_offset"
                  ></a>To date, only a few public policy actions have focused specifically on supporting women in facing the economic repercussions of the crisis. These include targeted cash transfers to women (Egypt) and exceptional paid leave for women employees (Palestinian Authority, Iraq). Governments have also been providing assistance to women entrepreneurs, with the support of international organisations, often in the form of online training programmes. </p>
                <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1125" class="web_offset"
                    ></a>Most of governments’ targeted efforts have focused on <strong>addressing the surge in gender-based violence</strong>. In particular, national domestic violence helplines have extended their operating hours to better support victims and additional phone services have been launched to provide legal and/or psychological assistance. Governments have also taken action to raise awareness on domestic violence issues and improve access to information for victims, in cooperation with civil society and international organisations. </p>
                <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1131" class="web_offset"
                    ></a>While the crisis has prompted some countries to integrate gender considerations into their response and/or adopt targeted measures to address the specific challenges faced by women, these initiatives should become more systematic and make the argument that <strong>women are key contributors to the economy</strong> and a major asset in the path towards economic recovery. </p>
                <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1137" class="web_offset"
                    ></a>The COVID-19 pandemic could also represent an opportunity to change prevailing gender norms in the region. Indeed, the crisis has contributed to reveal the major role and potential of women in MENA societies. <strong>Women not only represent the majority of front-line emergency responders in the health, social, teaching and care sectors, they have also been very active in setting up initiatives and businesses to support the response to the crisis</strong>. This situation could support a positive change in the perception of women’s contribution to the economy post-crisis. </p>

                    ></a>With the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, humanitarian and conflict-affected areas are at particular risk. The MENA region has experienced a <strong>dramatic flow of refugees and internally displaced persons</strong> over the last decade, with Jordan and Lebanon hosting among the highest number of refugees per capita worldwide. Jordan is home to 750,000 UNHCR-registered refugees, predominantly from Syria, while Lebanon hosts approximately 1.7 million refugees, including 1.5 million from Syria (as of November 2019). The situation for refugees is different in Jordan and Lebanon in terms of access to health and possibilities to obtain work permits. Many refugees live in <strong>densely populated camps or poorer urban areas</strong> with poorer health, water, sanitation and hygiene facilities. Preventive measures in these locations, such as washing hands regularly, social distancing and self-quarantine, are of paramount importance but difficult to implement. In <strong>conflict-affected areas</strong>, where health systems are already fragile and medical resources are scarce, refugees lack adequate access to both <strong>detection mechanisms and medical care, making it difficult to assess the prevalence of the pandemic</strong>.</p>

                      ></a>The Lebanese Ministry for Social Affairs unveiled early March a preventive plan elaborated in coordination with representatives from NGOs and international organisations to prevent the spread of the virus in areas hosting refugees. The plan involves awareness campaigns targeted at refugees and provision of disinfection equipment in camps. </p></li>

                      ></a>In Jordan, the government, in coordination with UNHCR, has put in place measures to ensure continued access to national health services for refugees, including the referral of suspected cases to quarantine sites, and the provision of requisite treatment. Temperature screening has been implemented at the entrance of two major refugee camps, electricity provision has been enhanced and the supermarkets are running extended hours to facilitate social distancing. In-kind aid distributions are offered through JHCO (Jordanian Hashemite Charity Organisation), including to refugees. </p></li>

                      ></a>International organisations have also mobilised to help the most fragile countries in the region in strengthening their capacity to respond to the crisis. In particular, the World Bank announced a USD 26.9 million grant to support Yemen’s efforts to contain the outbreak, the bulk of which will finance the procurement of medical equipment, rehabilitation of health facilities and emergency medical staff training. Discussions are ongoing to assess ways to directly ensure cash transfers to Syrian refugees in camps. In addition, the EU has approved close to 240 million EUR to strengthen resilience in neighbouring countries hosting Syrian refugees in light of the coronavirus pandemic.</p></li>

                <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1264" class="web_offset"
                    ></a>Despite these efforts, a number of challenges remain, both from the health and socio-economic perspectives. While to this day no major outbreaks have been reported in refugee camps across the region, the lack of or limited testing capacity in areas with a high concentration of refugees has raised concerns regarding the <strong>possibility of hidden COVID-19 outbreaks</strong>. This risk is compounded by the limited capacity of health systems in the region, which may lead to refugees being deprioritised in the health response. However, it is critical that national health systems take into account the testing and treatment of refugees. </p>
                <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1271" class="web_offset"
                    ></a>The outbreak will also put a severe strain on <strong>refugees’ economic security</strong>. The vast majority of refugees, in particular women, work in the informal sector, and more specifically in jobs where they earn their income on a daily basis. Severe restrictions preventing refugees from working raise important concerns as to their ability to continue providing for their basic needs, whereas refugees working in certain sectors particularly exposed, such as farming, might be even more at risk. Prolonged confinement measures risk exacerbating poverty among refugees. This poses significant challenges in countries such as Lebanon, where the World Bank estimates that approximately one third of refugees lived in poverty prior to the outbreak.  </p>
                <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1278" class="web_offset"
                    ></a>On the other hand, the outbreak of the pandemic may also have a severe impact on the process of refugee relocation, which is part of the asylum-seeking process. <strong>Border closures and travel restrictions are affecting the right to asylum</strong> as all resettlement procedures are currently suspended and forcing people to return to situations where they fear persecution or torture, violating the principle of non-refoulement. UN High Commissioner for Refugees recently voiced this concern, stating that while governments may put in place measures such as testing people seeking international protection upon entry and/or putting them in quarantine, such measures may not result in denying them an effective opportunity to seek asylum or result in refoulement.</p>
                <p class=""><a id="p-d1e1284" class="web_offset"
                    ></a>Moreover, in a region where currently some 50 million people are undernourished, governments will need to ensure a swift response to limit a further increase in <strong>food insecurity</strong> in the region that could result from the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. This risk will be exacerbated if disruptions in global food supplies due to the pandemic lead to food shortages and price hikes in MENA countries which are highly dependent on food imports.</p>
