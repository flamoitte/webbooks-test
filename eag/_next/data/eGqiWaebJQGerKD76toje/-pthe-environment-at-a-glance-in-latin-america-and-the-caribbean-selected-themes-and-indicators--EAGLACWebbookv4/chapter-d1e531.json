The first is to invest 1.3% of regional gross domestic product (GDP) for ten years, equivalent to USD 114 per capita (i.e. USD 80 billion in constant 2010 prices), with some countries needing a greater or lesser proportion of GDP depending on local circumstances. The second is to increase renewables technologies (mostly solar and wind) in line with the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) on access to affordable and clean energy.
