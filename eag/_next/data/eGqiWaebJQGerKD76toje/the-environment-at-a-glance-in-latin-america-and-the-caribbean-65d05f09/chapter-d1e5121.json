Direct budgetary transfers are one example of such measures. They are often provided to users to alleviate fuels costs and take the form of reimbursements to final consumers or to energy suppliers to compensate a (below-market) regulated price that ultimately benefits final consumers. By effectively reducing pre-tax fossil fuel prices, they act as a negative carbon price. This support type has been integrated to the ECR framework to construct effective carbon rates net of pre-tax direct transfers – i.e. Net ECR indicators.
