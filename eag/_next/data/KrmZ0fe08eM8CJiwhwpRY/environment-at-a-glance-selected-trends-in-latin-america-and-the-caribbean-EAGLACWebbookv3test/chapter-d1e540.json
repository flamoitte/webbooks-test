Many countries in LAC are experiencing a fall in agricultural productivity and tourism, as well as climate‑driven migration and high reconstruction costs after natural disasters.

During the hurricane season of 2017, an estimated loss of USD 52 million was recorded due to lower touristic activity. Natural disasters create a need to increase expenditure and thus have direct impacts on fiscal deficits and public revenues. On average, a natural disaster results in a reduction of public revenues equivalent to 0.8% and 1.1% of GDP, for lower middle‑income and low‑income countries respectively. In the case of the Caribbean, the annual cost of inaction to deal with the effects of sea level rise, is estimated to reach USD 22 billion per year by 2050 (10% of GDP) and USD 46 billion by 2100 (22% of GDP). In the case of Haiti and Puerto Rico, two of the three most affected countries in the world between 1999 and 2018, annual GDP losses reached 2.38% and 3.76%, respectively. If environmental degradation is not addressed soon, LAC governments will have to add the costs of climate change to those of social vulnerability.
