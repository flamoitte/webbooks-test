The initiative’s general goals are to accelerate the carbon neutrality of electricity systems in LAC; improve the resilience, competitiveness and sustainability of the sector; and create green jobs, improving air quality and minimising harmful health effects for Latin Americans.

The second is to increase renewables technologies (mostly solar and wind) in line with the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) on access to affordable and clean energy.
