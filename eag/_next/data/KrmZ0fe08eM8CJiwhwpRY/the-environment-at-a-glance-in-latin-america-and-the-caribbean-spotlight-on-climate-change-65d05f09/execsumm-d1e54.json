One area where countries need to do more is on market-based policy instruments, and in particular environmentally-related taxation. Current tax revenue is 0.9% of GDP, less than half the OECD average. LAC countries could consider increasing the use of environmentally-related taxes to free financial resources for social spendings, while reducing environmentally damaging activities. An example is carbon pricing. As part of their efforts to cut emissions, LAC countries have increased the use of carbon pricing both explicitly and implicitly -through fuel excise duties. In the region, carbon pricing is most commonly implemented in the road transport sector, followed by agriculture and fisheries. This is a positive step, but effective carbon rates remain much too low to effectively incentives curb emissions. Progressively increasing carbon prices (e.g. through the implementation of an Emission Trading Systems) while phasing out fossil fuel subsidies could help LAC countries implement the necessary incentives to reduce carbon emissions. However, the transition to net-zero involves using the right policy levers and a combination of market-based and non-market-based instruments that is consistent with countries’ specific circumstances."}]},{"type":"paragraph","id":"p-d1e192","align":"justify","content":[{"value":"Policies addressing climate change have many synergies with other environmental policies, such as biodiversity protection, land use change and air pollution.
