Between 1990 and 2019, the region’s GDP growth has oscillated around 2.7%, reaching a peak of 6.1% in 2006, and several contractionary troughs in 1995 and 2016. Despite strong economic growth, the region’s recovery from the COVID-19 crisis has seen a growth of (+ 7% in 2021), but the projections of a worldwide recession brought on by increased energy prices and inflation, as well as uncertainty in international markets, does not bode well are likely to impact for the economy of the LAC region (ECLAC, 2022)."}]},{"type":"paragraph","id":"p-d1e241","align":"justify","content":[{"value":"Fertile soils and mild climates have made agriculture the main economic and social activity.

The Pampa’s vast pastures feed South America’s livestock. Fisheries are the main economic activity along LAC’s Pacific coast, leading to overfishing and the depletion of many fish populations.
