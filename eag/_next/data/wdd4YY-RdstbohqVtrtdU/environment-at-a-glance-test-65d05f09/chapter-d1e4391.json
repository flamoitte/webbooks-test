They are calculated using estimates of the “Value of a Statistical Life” (VSL) and the number of premature deaths attributable to each environmental risk.

Since these supply-side measures are not directly linked to domestic energy use or emissions, the database does not cover them either. Similarly, the database does not include value added taxes (VAT) or sales taxes.
