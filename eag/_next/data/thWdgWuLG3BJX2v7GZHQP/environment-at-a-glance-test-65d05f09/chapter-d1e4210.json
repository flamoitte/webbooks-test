They are calculated using estimates of the “Value of a Statistical Life” (VSL) and the number of premature deaths attributable to each environmental risk. They exclude any morbidity impacts (labour productivity losses, treatment costs and willingness to pay to avoid pain and suffering from illness). They also exclude impacts other than those on human health (e.g. on built structures, agricultural productivity, ecosystem health). The social cost of the exposure to these environment-related risks is thus greater than the cost of mortalities presented in this chapter.
