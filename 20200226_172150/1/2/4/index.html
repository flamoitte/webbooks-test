The share of Indigenous Australians living in urban areas has increased from 73% in 1996 to 79% in 2016. This has been mainly driven by the larger proportion of Indigenous Australians living in state capitals, which rose from 30% to 35% between 1996 and 2016 <span class="web_bibref" id="d2e3828">(Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2016[1])</span>. Accordingly, the share of Indigenous Australians living in rural areas decreased from 27% in 1996 to 20% in 2016. The Northern Territory continues to have the highest proportion of Indigenous Australians living in rural areas (49%) of Australia’s states and territories. The Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and New South Wales contained the largest majorities of Indigenous Australians living in urban areas of 1&nbsp;000 or more, accounting for 99%, 87% and 86% of the Indigenous population respectively.</p><figure class="web_figure-container"><a id="figure-d1e5101" class="web_offset"></a><div class="web_figure-button web_figure-buttonclick"><span class="web_fullscreen"><i class="fa fa-expand web_color99" aria-hidden="true" title="Expand"></i></span></div><div class="web_block-share-btn"><div class="web_figure-button web_figure-buttonclick"><span class="web_sharegraph" title="Share"><i class="fa fa-share-alt"></i> Share</span></div></div><div class="web_figure-share"><a target="popup" title="Facebook" class="social-fb web_toc-link web_share" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/20200226_172150/1/2/4/21.html"><i class="fa fa-facebook" aria-hidden="true"></i></a><a target="popup" title="Twitter" class="social-tw web_toc-link web_share" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Share%20of%20urban%20and%20rural%20Indigenous%20Australians%20by%20state%20and%20territory%2C%202016&amp;url=https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/20200226_172150/1/2/4/21.html"><i class="fa fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true"></i></a><a title="Linkedin" class="social-ln web_toc-link web_share" onclick="this.target='popup'" target="popup" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/20200226_172150/1/2/4/21.html&amp;title=Share%20of%20urban%20and%20rural%20Indigenous%20Australians%20by%20state%20and%20territory%2C%202016&amp;summary=https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/20200226_172150/1/2/4/21.html&amp;source=OECD"><i class="fa fa-linkedin" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></div><div class="web_figure-expand"><span class="web_headline-link web_copyFigureLink" data-customLabel="copyFigureLink" id="copy-figure-d1e5101"><i class="fa fa-link"></i><span class="web_tooltiptext">copy the link</span><span class="web_tooltiptextcopied">link copied!</span></span><div class="web_figure-heading"><span class="web_prefix-num">Figure 3.1. </span>Share of urban and rural Indigenous Australians by state and territory, 2016</div><img class="web_img-responsive web_center-block web_img-max" src="../../../images/images/04_chapter3/media/image2.png" alt="Figure 3.1.

One example of this is the Indigenous designed and led Empowered Communities initiative being implemented in eight regions, where Indigenous communities and governments are working together to set priorities, improve services and apply funding effectively at a regional level. Importantly, it also aims to increase Indigenous ownership and give Indigenous Australians a greater say in decisions that affect them.

As shown in Chapter 1, the non-Indigenous population has higher levels of tertiary education (Bachelor’s Degree and above) than Indigenous Australians. This is the case across all Greater Capital Cities or Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSAs), where the share of Indigenous Australians with at least a Bachelor’s Degree is lower than the non-Indigenous Australian population (see <a class="web_a" href="../../../1/2/4/2/1/1/index.html">Figure&nbsp;3.3</a>). In Greater Brisbane, Greater Adelaide, Greater Perth, Greater Hobart and Greater Darwin, less than 10% of Indigenous Australians have a Bachelor’s Degree or above, while in Greater Melbourne and Greater Sydney slightly more than 10% do so. Indigenous Australians in the Australian Capital Territory have the highest level of educational attainment across GCCSAs as 18.8% have at least a Bachelor’s Degree. </p><p class=""><a id="p-d1e5252" class="web_offset"></a>Indigenous Australians in urban areas tend to have poorer labour market outcomes than the rest of the population. Similar to the trends at the national level analysed in Chapter 2, employment rates are lower and unemployment rates higher for Indigenous Australians than the rest of the population across GCCSAs (see <a class="web_a" href="../../../1/2/4/2/1/2/index.html">Figure 3.4</a>). This suggests that a large share of the urban Indigenous workforce are jobless and/or looking for a job. The difference in employment rates between Indigenous Australians and the rest of the population is greater than 15 percentage points in Greater Perth and Greater Darwin, while the unemployment rate is more than 10 percentage points higher for Indigenous Australians than for the rest of the population in Greater Perth and Greater Adelaide.</p><figure class="web_figure-container"><a id="figure-d1e5261" class="web_offset"></a><div class="web_figure-button web_figure-buttonclick"><span class="web_fullscreen"><i class="fa fa-expand web_color99" aria-hidden="true" title="Expand"></i></span></div><div class="web_block-share-btn"><div class="web_figure-button web_figure-buttonclick"><span class="web_sharegraph" title="Share"><i class="fa fa-share-alt"></i> Share</span></div></div><div class="web_figure-share"><a target="popup" title="Facebook" class="social-fb web_toc-link web_share" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/20200226_172150/1/2/4/23.html"><i class="fa fa-facebook" aria-hidden="true"></i></a><a target="popup" title="Twitter" class="social-tw web_toc-link web_share" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Share%20of%20Indigenous%20and%20non-Indigenous%20Australians%20with%20a%20Bachelor%E2%80%99s%20Degree%20and%20above%20by%20Greater%20Capital%20City%2C%202016&amp;url=https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/20200226_172150/1/2/4/23.html"><i class="fa fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true"></i></a><a title="Linkedin" class="social-ln web_toc-link web_share" onclick="this.target='popup'" target="popup" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/20200226_172150/1/2/4/23.html&amp;title=Share%20of%20Indigenous%20and%20non-Indigenous%20Australians%20with%20a%20Bachelor%E2%80%99s%20Degree%20and%20above%20by%20Greater%20Capital%20City%2C%202016&amp;summary=https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/20200226_172150/1/2/4/23.html&amp;source=OECD"><i class="fa fa-linkedin" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></div><div class="web_figure-expand"><span class="web_headline-link web_copyFigureLink" data-customLabel="copyFigureLink" id="copy-figure-d1e5261"><i class="fa fa-link"></i><span class="web_tooltiptext">copy the link</span><span class="web_tooltiptextcopied">link copied!</span></span><div class="web_figure-heading"><span class="web_prefix-num">Figure 3.3. </span>Share of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians with a Bachelor’s Degree and above by Greater Capital City, 2016</div><div class="web_figure-subheading">People aged 15 and above</div><img class="web_img-responsive web_center-block web_img-max" src="../../../images/images/04_chapter3/media/image4.png" alt="Figure 3.3.

However, urban centres and cities in Australia are spaces where local stakeholders can meet and engage community members on innovative solutions to Indigenous employment challenges.

Cities in Australia can play a key role in establishing strong connections with both Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations to create a local dialogue about Indigenous employment and economic development opportunities.

However, if these quotas are not fulfilled, there are very little consequences. At most, a contract may not be renewed or a company may be less likely to secure future contracts.

IBSS seeks put Indigenous businesses at the forefront of the Australian economy and draws on solutions put forward by Indigenous businesses. Reflecting this intention to tailor support to Indigenous Australian, there has been a strong emphasis on consultation and ensuring culturally appropriate support and services in the design and delivery of the IBSS. The Government carried out an extensive consultation process with the Indigenous business sector during policy creation. In this consultation, Indigenous businesses identified four critical areas for development and growth, reflecting several of the success factors discussed above: (i) better business support, (ii) improved access to finance, (iii) stronger connections and relationships and (iv) better sharing of information about commercial opportunities. </p><p class=""><a id="p-d1e6212" class="web_offset"></a>The IBSS includes measures to improve access to finance, including an expanded microfinance scheme and a new Indigenous Entrepreneurs Capital Scheme.
