The management of ESIF involves a complex ecosystem of actors – from multiple levels of government, to private firms and non-profit entities. Clear, evidence-based strategies are essential to intelligently direct ESIF to where they are most needed and likely to have a positive impact; effective co-ordination and communication among actors, including beneficiaries, is necessary to ensure the maximum impact from the use of the Funds; and having the right skills and capacities is core to good project management.

In the current 2014-2020 programming period, EUR 461 billion was allocated to the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). National co-financing brings the total to EUR 647 billion available for ESIF investment in the European Union. Given the breadth and importance of ESIF, making the most of the opportunities it offers rests on ensuring quality institutions and administrative capacities as well as effective governance and management mechanisms."},{"name": "index.html#p-d1e615","text": "Administrative capacities matter for the effectiveness and impact of ESIF. In particular, quality governance practices, institutions and institutional practices can positively affect the returns to Cohesion Policy investment, regional competitiveness and economic growth. Thus, it is essential to invest in governance, to build adequate capabilities to manage EU funds among all levels of government, and to design strong investment strategies. These concepts are key tenets of the OECD Recommendation of Effective Public Investment across Levels of Government. Ahead of the 2021-2027 programming period, the European Commission launched a pilot project to support ESIF Managing Authorities (MAs) in the development of Roadmaps aimed at strengthening their administrative capacities to effectively oversee, administer and evaluate the use of ESIF. Five MAs were selected by DG REGIO to participate in this project – three at the national level and two at the regional level. The findings in this report draw from the project undertaken with these five MAs. From this selected group, MAs throughout the ESIF management system may recognise similar challenges, and the lessons are broadly applicable not only to EU Member State Managing Authorities, but to public sector institutions charged with designing and implementing investment strategies and seeking to strengthen their capacities to do so."},{"name": "index.html#p-d1e626","text": "Each MA in the pilot displayed specific challenges relating to diverse issues, including local market conditions, distinct governance structures and the precise combinations of thematic objectives. Despite the individual characteristics of each MA, including size, territorial scope (national or regional), level of expertise in ESIF management, etc., common threads in terms of challenges, experiences, needs and (occasionally) solutions, emerged throughout the diagnostic phase and in stakeholder interviews. Although each MA is affected to different degrees by the challenges listed below, a key observation of this project is that all five of the MAs – and most likely more beyond this sample – will recognise elements of these challenges that apply to them."},{"name": "index.html#p-d1e637","text": "MAs generally have skilled and professional staff, but these are not perceived or managed as a strategic asset. Most staff in MAs are managed in traditional hierarchal settings where talent management is not perceived strategically for achieving the goals of ESIF investments. This often leads to some skills shortages or the misallocation of skills, a lack of formalisation around job profiles and roles, and poor anticipation of skills needs and workforce planning."},{"name": "index.html#p-d1e643","text": "There is a widespread desire for more training, but learning and development modules lack a strategic vision and are under-utilised. Most MAs have training modules designed to keep staff up to date with legislative and regulatory developments. Beyond these core modules, training is not perceived by staff as useful to their career development. Competences for ESIF administration have rarely been defined, and as such, learning and development is not systematically aligned with core competency development."},{"name": "index.html#p-d1e649","text": "MAs need to be able to recruit and retain top talent, but feel constrained in their options for addressing this. Managing ESIF requires deploying a range of skills and technical knowledge, but many MAs lack the flexibility and agility to do so. MAs face competition in terms of attracting necessary skills, and existing human resource management policies are often rigid and slow. Opportunities for mobility is often limited, with many staff sitting in flat hierarchies with little chance of meaningful career progression. Over time, employee engagement can be affected, and in some MAs, turn-over is high."},{"name": "index.html#p-d1e662","text": "MAs face common challenges in their strategic approach to Operational Programme implementation and the ESIF investment cycle, which affect spending effectiveness. Regardless of country contexts and degree of experience with ESIF financing, there is generally room to enhance capacity in strategic Operational Programme (OP) design, priority setting, information and knowledge sharing, and performance measurement. Doing so could help MAs better capture synergies within their OPs and across Priority Axes, create more integrated investment processes, optimise OP implementation processes throughout the investment cycle, and eventually enhance investment impact."},{"name": "index.html#p-d1e668","text": "There is room to build stronger partnerships among Operational Programme stakeholders, particularly with beneficiaries, including through more customised approaches. MAs are fundamental partners in ensuring the effective use of ESIF as a means to attain Cohesion Policy and national development goals. Intermediate Bodies (IBs) and especially beneficiaries, as the final recipients of EU funds, play a decisive role in the ESIF investment process. There is room to better support the capacity of these two groups – and especially that of beneficiaries – to manage and undertake ESIF financed projects throughout the OP investment cycle. Tailoring communication and capacity-building to their needs is one approach. This additional consideration can be fundamental to establishing and maintaining constructive partnerships with OP stakeholders, particularly beneficiaries."},{"name": "index.html#p-d1e681","text": "Framework conditions exert significant pressure on Operational Programme implementation, ultimately affecting absorption capacity. Framework conditions are generally outside an MA’s direct control, however, they strongly affect the capacity of MAs to smoothly manage OP investment. Frequent changes to regulatory and legal frameworks (both national and European-level), “one-size-fits all” approaches to OP implementation, inconsistent interpretations in control, verification and audit processes, and complex and/or opaque procurement laws all contribute to generating administrative burden and high transaction costs. This can result in implementation delays, financial corrections, mistrust in the system and, at an extreme, a disincentive among beneficiaries to use ESIF. MAs and other parties, including Intermediate Bodies (IBs), must work together to manage difficulties as quickly and efficiently as possible. It is also important to consider active consultation with MAs and IBs when designing the framework conditions that structure their work."},{"name": "index.html#p-d1e694","text": "There is room for greater innovation in how MAs operate and in the practical implementation of Operational Programmes. The structures and processes framing ESIF management and implementation aim to minimise risk and mitigate potential fraud or error. This is highly reasonable. Meanwhile, the mechanisms established to accomplish this may be stifling the capacity of national and regional MAs to be innovative in diverse activities, including how they administer and manage their staff and organisations, and how they design and select projects. In turn, this may limit how effectively they can meet higher level objectives or their desired investment outcomes."},{"name": "index.html#p-d1e700","text": "Initiatives to build the administrative capacity of MAs should be undertaken at the appropriate scale. There is a significant amount that MAs can do to build their capacity for more effective OP investment, particularly with respect to those matters that lie within their organisational mandate. There are other matters, however, that affect their ability to act and invest effectively, and overcoming these requires support from higher-level bodies. Human resources is an example. While MAs may be short-staffed and/or under-skilled, they often lack the authority and/or incentive to hire additional employees and train them to the extent necessary, due to regulations set centrally that apply to the broader public service. Furthermore, being heard on such matters as burdensome procedures, or inconsistent control results, and working to find practicable solutions cannot come from one MA alone, but must come from MAs as group. These then need to bubble up to the appropriate higher-level authorities for consideration and action. This type of unity and dialogue among MAs in a country does not seem to occur as often as it should or could. Finally, many of the actions found in the Roadmaps developed through this pilot could be better leveraged at a higher-level – through the Management and Control System or at National Coordination Body-level, for example. Doing so may have greater impact than taking an MA-by-MA approach. Actions could be easier to implement and have a broader impact on the administration and use of ESIF in a country, better supporting the ability of EU Member States to meet Cohesion Policy objectives."},{"name": "index.html#p-d1e706","text": ""},{"name": "1/2/1/index.html#chapter-d1e709","text": "Building administrative capacity for Cohesion Policy financingBuilding administrative capacity for Cohesion Policy financing"},{"name": "1/2/1/index.html#p-d1e718","text": "This chapter provides an overview of European Structural and Investment Funds and Cohesion Policy in light of current trends in public investment.

Second, encouraging productivity growth is critical to ensuring greater well-being as it can have a positive impact on income and jobs, health, and access to services. One ingredient for promoting such growth is investment in both “hard” (e.g. transport, energy, Information and Communication Technology, etc.) and “soft” infrastructure (e.g. research and development, human capital and skills, social and community services, etc.), a focus of this current programming period.

The fiscal consolidation strategies and austerity packages that followed the crisis in OECD member countries strongly affected public investment, which was mainly used as an adjustment variable (OECD, 2011[7]; 2013[8]). This also holds true in the European Union. Of the EU 28 countries, public investment has declined since the 2008 crisis. There was a stabilisation between 2012 and 2016, but this was followed by a slight decline in 2015, which can be partially explained by fiscal consolidation, as well as the impact of ESIF. According to the European Investment Bank (EIB), in recent years and among countries that are heavily dependent on ESIF, these funds accounted for around two-fifths of public investment, or nearly 2% of GDP. This caused them to suffer from a “cliff effect” suddenly turning negative after the 2015 deadline for payments under the 2007-2013 programming period (EIB, 2016[9]). Entering the 2014-2020 programming period, and since 2017, public investment started to rise, as countries and regions implement ESIF investments (Figure 1.2). Nevertheless, according to the 2018/2019 EIB report, while public investment is gradually picking up, it remains low.

This is equivalent to about USD 6.3 trillion per year in the next 15 years. To this should be added an additional USD 300 billion annually if climate concerns are taken into consideration (OECD, 2017[13]); and in the EU, a further EUR 100-150 billion will be needed between 2018 and 2030 to bridge an investment gap in social infrastructure (European Commission, 2018[14]). The sticking point, however, is that investment in global infrastructure currently amounts to about USD 2.5 trillion per year (McKinsey Global Institute, 2016[15]; Brookings Insitution, New Climate Economy, and Grantham Research Insitute, 2015[16]). In addition, investment in physical infrastructure alone is not enough to secure regional growth and development – it is only one of many contributing factors. It is just as important to ensure effective investment in “soft infrastructure” such as a robust business environment and appropriate human capital formation. Many, if not all, of these hard and soft infrastructure needs are captured in the EU’s 11 Thematic Objectives (investment priorities) for the 2014-2020 programming period (European Commission, n.d.[17])."},{"name": "1/2/1/index.html#p-d1e1051","text": "A growing body of work points to the positive effects of public investment on growth, and OECD research shows that countries with higher levels of public investment increase their productivity faster than countries with lower levels of public investment (Fournier, 2016[18]).

Several studies show that improving the management of public investment can also lead to substantial savings and enhanced productivity (OECD, 2013[8]; IMF, 2015[19]; McKinsey Global Institute, 2016[15]; McKinsey Global Institute, 2013[20]).

For the five countries participating in this project, ESIF remains a major source of public investment for projects designed to stimulate economic development, sustain SMEs, and boost entrepreneurship and employment. Designed to reduce infra- and intra-regional disparities, and more generally to improve inclusion and well-being, Cohesion Policy thus represents the “visible hand” of the EU. The EC provides many examples of successful projects funded through ESIF: for example, ESIF financing has been used to reduce the energy consumption of public and private buildings in Bulgaria and to build modern motorways in Greece. In Croatia, ESIF is providing valuable support to improve the competitiveness of SMEs.

Thus the OECD has recently worked closely with member countries to develop the 2019 OECD Recommendation on Public Service Leadership and Capability (PSLC) which sets out 14 principles for a fit-for-purpose public service workforce. The People dimension of this framework follows the second pillar of the PSLC which promotes civil service capacity to achieve operational and strategic objectives, in this case by identifying the mix of skills and competences needed in a high performing MA. It looks at how skills gaps are identified and addressed, both by attracting and recruiting the skills and expertise needed from the labour market, and by using learning and development tools, including training, to build workforce capacity. It also looks at how the workforce can be motivated to put its skills to best use. This suggests a review of incentives and performance management systems to set goals and measure their progress towards them, as well as the role of leaders and managers to motivate their employees."},{"name": "1/2/1/index.html#p-d1e2632","text": "Women and men with the right skills also require an organisational structure and support that enable and empower them to put their skills to work.

Employee actions are shaped to a large degree by the system in which they operate. This is the second level of analysis. This dimension looks at the systems, tools, business processes and culture that influence how staff of the MAs work. It looks at whether these tools and systems are aligned to the MA’s strategic objectives, and supported by agile governance structures to facilitate effective data-informed decision-making. HR systems bring in the right people and support them to contribute, and effective organisational development ensures people are able to deliver.

In a survey conducted by the OECD and Committee of the Regions (CoR) in 2015, poor strategic planning was identified one of the most important challenges for public investment, beyond the financing challenge (OECD-CoR, 2015[58]). The OECD Recommendation on Effective Public Investment across Levels of Government (OECD, 2014[29]) emphasises the pre-conditions for good strategic planning, in particular for the involvement of external stakeholders and private actors. The Principles also stress the importance of coordinating across levels of government, and across jurisdictions, as well as cross-sectoral coordination for effective investment strategies. The Recommendation, with 12 Principles, is complemented with an Implementation Toolkit that includes a set of indicators to help countries, regions, cities and other local authorities self-assess their strategic planning capacities, the bottlenecks they face, and the priorities for action (OECD, 2019[30])."},{"name": "1/2/1/index.html#p-d1e2691","text": "Appropriate framework conditions are crucial for creating an enabling environment for all level of government to invest effectively.

In this way, there was insufficient concern for developing and leveraging policy skills in the MA that could contribute to the design and development of ROPs, and align the work of the MA to the regional development strategies that they advance. Given the proximity of the MA to the delivery of strategy, this raises risks around misalignment of MA activities (e.g. project selection) with strategic objectives. If an MA uses only operational KPIs (e.g. amount spent, number of financial corrections), for example, it may risk not achieving the objectives of the policies that guide their work. In addition, MAs have a lot of practical experience that could be leveraged for better ROP/regional development strategy development."},{"name": "1/2/2/index.html#p-d1e4263","text": "Service delivery and engagement: While MAs may not deliver services directly to citizens, they do so with beneficiaries.

There was often recognition that beneficiaries not only needed more information and support to prepare and implement projects, but also had insights that could be used to improve the design of strategies and processes by the MA. Part of the challenge is that stakeholder management and engagement tend not to be a professionalised function in most of the MAs that participated in this pilot action, and therefore is often undertaken by people who do not see it as core to their work, and who lack the necessary skills and time."},{"name": "1/2/2/index.html#p-d1e4269","text": "Commissioning and contracting: MAs carry out a range of actions related to the control, distribution and use of ESIF funds, such as ex-post control and reviewing the lawfulness of public procurement during verification of beneficiary expenses.

Rarely do employees of an MA have a background in engineering or other technical specialties that would enable them to fully understand the complexity of the projects they manage. With this kind of skills asymmetry, many MAs resort to rule-oriented process specialisation (e.g. ensuring that forms are filled out correctly) rather than substance and understanding (e.g. ensuring that what’s in the forms really makes sense and is viable). A related challenge is that the rules they follow are often perceived to be somewhat vague and open to interpretation, and therefore require a high degree of legal understanding and authority.

In these departments, however, few if any “specialists” in ESIF funds management exist. Some of these departments have assigned dedicated staff, with expertise in the specific rules and regulations governing the use of European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), to these projects, but others assign personnel on an ad hoc basis, often because there are insufficient staff to have dedicated resources. However, this practice, combined with often changing rules and regulations, resulted in a failure to build institutional knowledge and expertise in ESIF management over the longer-term.

This approach can ensure clarity in response, but there does not appear to be a mechanism in place to share the knowledge imparted among the different regions and thereby enable them to answer more questions at source.

Project managers reported during the diagnostic phase that unexpected issues often occurred – a shortage of suppliers to contract, price changes, unexpected (high or low) interest to certain calls for proposals, etc. Managers often found themselves in situations where they had to either fast-track or delay projects, but were met with high resistance from “the system” in terms of moving and shifting financial and human resources as needed.

This practice provides line ministries with the means to reallocate resources between programmes under their sectoral responsibility. This decentralisation of responsibility has helped align the incentives for ministries to better manage their budgets and to innovate in order to make the best use of limited resources. Moreover, in recent years countries have facilitated managerial flexibility by permitting other practices including: re-appropriations within the same fiscal year (transferring funds between programmes or line items); allowing carry-overs (the shift of unused appropriations to future fiscal years); and the borrowing against future appropriations (spend their appropriation for the year in the knowledge that they will be able to borrow from next year’s appropriation if unexpected spending needs arise) (OECD, 2014[5]).

For example, if a project was delayed, managers felt they were unable to shift funds to another project or carry-over funds to future fiscal years for the initially planned project. Interestingly, some of these constraints may be perceived rather than actual. While MAs maintained the perception that budgetary rules were rigid, auditors and Ministries of Finance argued that flexibility measures were in place yet not used.

Following the crisis, fairly recent reforms to downsize or limit the growth of the public service workforce through hiring freezes, coupled with constant pressures to contain costs and increase value for money, have limited the capacity of MAs to manage human resources in a more strategic way. This stemmed from hiring freezes that did not allow MAs to recruit the required skillsets needed, but also from rigid procedures that did not allow the re-assignment of personnel to match work demands across institutions. Staff seemed to sit in rigid hierarchies for many years with unclear promotion prospects and opaque criteria around the possibility and value of internal mobility. Furthermore, in some of the MAs, there appeared to be a lack of formalisation around job roles and hierarchical levels across MCS/MA systems, which resulted in people doing the same work but for different pay. This also limited mobility since standard roles and pay scales did not facilitate the movement of people across organisations within the MCS.

Equally important, more could be done to ensure that beneficiaries and other stakeholders are engaged and capacitated, and that performance measurement practices are more strategic, less cumbersome and contribute evidence bases for the development of future Partnership Agreements (PAs) and the OPs that support them. In the forthcoming programming period, these challenges may become accentuated among MAs that move to a greater delegation of functions to regional levels, unless mechanisms are in place to manage them at all levels of OP implementation."},{"name": "1/2/4/index.html#p-d1e6756","text": "The capacity of national and subnational institutions to design effective strategies, allocate appropriate resources and efficiently administer EU funds can have a positive incidence on the contribution of Cohesion Policy to the economic development of a territory (Bachtler, Mendez and Oraže, 2014[3]). While not the case for all MAs, in those instances where the links between higher-level strategic documents (e.g. national or regional development plans, sectoral development strategies, etc.) are weak, unclear or missing, the result is greater difficulty in seeing the “big picture” and a tendency to get entwined in the technical details and immediate needs of specific projects and OP implementation. Making sure the links between different levels of strategic documents are clear to staff can help better support their capacity to make decisions and undertake day-to-day activities that advance operations. Often, strategic gaps can be seen in project selection and appraisal, as well as in the monitoring and evaluation of OPs. For example, project appraisal indicators or the way MAs monitor the programme progress tends to ensure the degree of “formality” but not necessarily evaluate strategic impact (i.e. outcomes), be it of an individual project or the OP as a whole. Weak strategic underpinnings for OP implementation can lead an MA to focus primarily on the short-term (e.g. rapid absorption) and on technicalities. This can manifest by using the funds in ways that align most closely with past use (limiting the risk of non-compliance with technical guidelines), rather than taking a longer-term strategic approach and promoting investments that may be slightly more innovative (though may require more support to ensure compliance) and which may contribute more effectively to meeting national and regional development objectives."},{"name": "1/2/4/index.html#p-d1e6768","text": "Several obstacles impede a more strategic approach to OP planning, programming and priority setting among MAs.

For ESIF, this strategic guideline is embodied in the PA between the European Commission and EU Member States, with OPs being the means to implement the strategy. PAs and OPs are frequently developed in parallel. An EU study indicates this to be the case about 60% of the time for Cohesion Policy OPs (EC-DG REGIO, 2016[4]). While it was frequently the PA that provided the strategic framework for OPs, thereby facilitating the ability to establish a clear hierarchy between the two frameworks, in the case of European Social Fund (ESF) particularly, strategic issues were often first decided through the OP (European Commission, 2016[5]). The reasons behind this may include a need to respond quickly to planning requests, as well as limited experience working within the Cohesion Policy and ESIF structures (particularly in the case of newer EU Member States)."},{"name": "1/2/4/index.html#p-d1e6800","text": "At a national level, a clearly articulated long-term investment strategy, be it for overall development or for a specific sector, can help align priorities between the OP and national level objectives.

This is particularly important for regional MAs and Regional Operational Programmes (ROPs). ROP programming ideally should reflect territorial specificities, be aligned to regional development needs, and be adapted to different local contexts, such as the degree of subnational autonomy, market conditions, or institutional or beneficiary capacities. For example, national MAs can provide tailored support to regional MAs to improve their OP or ROP implementation capacities in cases where there is a misalignment between OP objectives and regional “market” realities. In addition, development strategies serve as additional guidance for ensuring that the OPs/ROPs help regional actors meet broader development and investment goals. For example, in 2011-2012, Poland introduced the Long Term National Development Strategy: Poland 2030: The Third Wave of Modernity. Before that, Poland put in place the Medium Term National Development Strategy (MTNDS), setting out strategic development objectives for the country from 2010 to 2020, and identifying key development activities, including those that could be supported by EU funds in the 2014-2020 period. Nine integrated strategies, including the National Strategy for Regional Development 2010-2020, were also developed under the MTNDS, aiming to assist the achievement of the development objectives (Polish Minstry of Economic Development, 2017[6]). Similarly, the Czech Republic is creating a National Investment Plan covering the period up to 2030, which aims to be financed by the state budget, ESIF resources, and private investors, among others. The Plan includes a long-term fiscal framework and, having gathered information on local needs, targets transport, energy and other infrastructure as primary national investment priorities based on identified local needs (OECD, 2019[7])."},{"name": "1/2/4/index.html#p-d1e6828","text": "Just as important as ensuring links between higher level strategies and OPs, is ensuring that MAs have input into their OP’s design at the very early stages. An OECD study on the governance of infrastructure investment highlights that, in many countries, consultation with stakeholders tends to take place in the investment preparation phase but is less common in setting an overall vision, prioritising investments or assessing needs (OECD, 2017[8]). Responsibility for preparing the various framework documents that provide strategic guidance to OPs, be they national or sector strategies, or the country’s Partnership Agreement with the EU, rests with the national authorities and line ministries. MAs are implementing agents who work under determined structures and framework conditions. Yet they have expertise and knowledge that is valuable for not only OP implementation, but for future programming as well. Thus, if they are not responsible for designing or structuring their OP, bringing their perspective into the early discussion phase is part of the strategic planning component of the investment cycle. Doing so helps responsible authorities tap into an MA’s experience with OP implementation and their understanding of beneficiary needs, as well as what may or may not work. This, in turn, helps better align the OPs with sectoral and regional investment needs and specificities, and maximise coherence among policies and programmes. It can also help MAs identify, early on, where the synergies and complementarities lie within their OP to effective design Priority Axes programming in a way that harnesses these ex ante, rather than trying to accomplish the task ex post."},{"name": "1/2/4/index.html#p-d1e6887","text": "Strategic priority setting can be complex and require a sophisticated approach to balance different factors. It is, however, fundamental in order to focus programme implementation and avoid wasting resources on secondary issues, thereby supporting more effective and efficient absorption of ESIF. MAs must take into consideration the higher-level priorities established in the PA, as well as national and often regional priorities for development and their capacity (including resources) to invest. Balancing these various factors can be tricky. In a case study of Scotland’s European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) OPs (2014-2020), stakeholders stated that one of the challenges affecting policy efficiency and additionality was the discrepancy between the priorities set conceptually and strategically (e.g. a focus on research and development investment as part of the ‘smart growth’ agenda) and the availability of local match funding, as well as the match funding to be ensured by third sector organisations, to actually develop and deliver projects in specific areas (Dozhdeva, Mendez and Bachtler, 2018[9]). Investment priorities can also be influenced by different actors (e.g. government agencies, ministries etc.), whose objectives are supported by OP spending. This adds additional complexity to the MA’s work when considering which investments may most effectively respond to national and subnational needs and aims. Balancing technical requirements established by the EU (e.g. eligible costs, ring-fencing, mid-term review based on performance framework, etc.) and strategic considerations associated with investment needs and capacity – be they national, sectoral or regional – is an intricate task for the MAs when setting priorities. In addition, care needs to be taken that priority-setting is not driven by the inertia of out-of-date plans, prior assumptions, or narrow political considerations (OECD, 2013[1])."},{"name": "1/2/4/index.html#p-d1e6907","text": "The importance of a multi-stakeholder or “partnership” approach to investment planning processes cannot be emphasised enough. Strong top-down processes in priority setting can weaken OP implementation by limiting stakeholder input and the ability to take into consideration the needs and capacities of beneficiaries, be they regional or local authorities, the private sector, civil society or others. There is evidence indicating that strategies combining top-down with bottom-up approaches are among the most effective (Crescenzi and Giua, 2016[10]). This pilot illustrated that top-down approaches could originate at a national level or at the MA level vis-à-vis beneficiaries. This was illustrated by instances where priorities are established at a central level based on the impact they are expected to achieve regionally; and instances where the contribution to priority identification and setting by subnational-government beneficiaries is limited. Regardless of where a top-down approach originates, bringing OP stakeholders into the process of defining and validating priorities (and investment needs) can help ensure priority robustness, add to evidence bases, and increase the potential for project take up when calls are made. Setting priorities, and acting on them effectively, requires fruitful co-ordination and communication within the MA and between the MA and other ESIF stakeholders, including regional governments (where applicable), the national government and the European Commission, as well as Intermediate Bodies (IBs), regional and local authorities and beneficiaries. This can help ensure that subnational specificities, beneficiary capacities and overall investment needs are further integrated into the process, thereby facilitating more effective OP implementation. It can also generate greater trust by lending a greater degree of transparency to the whole OP investment process – a process that may be considered opaque, particularly by private sector beneficiaries. For example, in London, the London Economic Action Partnership brings together entrepreneurs, businesses, the Mayoralty and the London Council in order to identify investment priorities and strategic actions of ESIF programmes to support job creation and economic growth in the capital. A Committee is also set up within this Partnership to oversee the ESIF programmes and ensure that they meet the strategic priorities of London (ECORYS, n.d.[11])."},{"name": "1/2/4/index.html#p-d1e6935","text": "OPs are all, or almost all, composite structures, formed by a number of different Priority Axes. With composite structures, bringing together the various relevant sectors involved to contribute input into programme and project design and/or implementation can improve capacity to identify and capitalise on cross-sector synergies and strengthen strategic complementarities. While most Priority Axes and related programmes can benefit from cross-sector input, their design, priorities and associated projects can often and easily be organised by line ministries working vertically within their sectors, or central authorities responsible for ESIF programming. Many countries commonly apply this sector-oriented approach to infrastructure investment. In an OECD survey of infrastructure governance, 12 out of 27 respondents stated that infrastructure development was linked to sectoral plans and generally not developed in an integrated (i.e. cross-sector) fashion (OECD, 2017[8]). There is nothing inherently wrong in this, as sector strategies are very helpful, especially for sector driven MAs (e.g. MAs responsible for environment, transport, energy, education, etc.). However, its effectiveness also rests with cross-sector consultation and coordinated, mutually-reinforcing programming. Not doing so may accentuate a fragmented implementation approach where the priorities of individual ministries or relevant institutional bodies compete rather than complement each other, limiting the ability of MAs to achieve OP objectives in a strategic manner."},{"name": "1/2/4/index.html#p-d1e6947","text": "However, sectoral actors, including line ministries, often lack mechanisms and incentives to identify and capitalise on synergies and complementarities, or such mechanisms and incentives are not institutionalised, or they are insufficient. Introducing a horizontal or integrated approach when programming is designed and/or implemented by bringing together various sectors, can rapidly help identify and capitalise on complementarities or synergies, and national coordination bodies can play an important role in this regard. In Spain, for example, the public policy thematic network “Red de Políticas de I+D+I” focusing on R&D and innovation was established to exchange information on Cohesion Policy implementation across the country and promote the coordinated use of the Structural Funds with other policies, including coordination among different government levels. In the 2014-2020 period, the role of this network was formally included in the Partnership Agreement as well as in national and regional OPs (European Parliament - DG Internal Policies, 2016[12]). In the current programming period, the European Commission has introduced some new features and instruments aiming to reinforce an integrated territorial approach to ESIF. These include Integrated Sustainable Urban Development (ISUD), Integrated Territorial Investment (ITI) (a tool to achieve ISUD) (Box 4.2), and Community Led Local Development (CLLD) financed by the Structural and the Rural Development Funds.

In most cases, ITIs are used for large infrastructure investments that draw from ERDF and involve cross-jurisdiction cooperation. In spite of the potential benefits of ITIs, the uptake is limited for a number of reasons, including: limitations in national laws (e.g. with respect to creating joint municipal bodies or associations), complex implementation arrangements precisely due to legal obstacles, and limited capacity (at the local and/or MA levels).

Starting the preparation of ITIs early in the programming cycle, and clearly identifying objectives and potential programmes to support these, can be valuable, as was the case of the Netherlands, where Dutch cities started to prepare ITIs and had discussions with the European Commission in 2012, two-years ahead of the 2014-2020 programming period."},{"name": "1/2/4/index.html#p-d1e6998","text": "Additional challenges associated with ITI use include establishing a coherent framework by which the mechanism can help address a variety of territorial challenges, reconciling territorial and sector polices, and ensuring solid territorial development strategies.

It is the first pillar in the OECD Recommendation for more Effective Public Investment across Levels of Government, and a lack of coordination across sectors was identified as a challenge in the 2016 OECD/CoR survey highlighted in Box 4.1. A number of factors can affect coordination capacity. For example, cross-sector coordination can be stymied by a lack of political will or an administrative culture unaccustomed to working cooperatively across sectors or among different levels of government (OECD-CoR, 2016[20]). The lack of coordination among sectoral and territorial approaches, policies and programmes is a long standing problem in many countries, and affects ESIF management. Such a situation can arise if the coordinating ministry is deemed weak by line ministries who subsequently resist coordination efforts, or when the mix of instruments and programmes or calls lead to perverse or split incentives (Kalman, 2002[21]). It can also lead to a duplication of tasks and confusion in the system (Bachtler, Mendez and Oraže, 2014[3]).

In the end, this can contribute to better adherence (EC-DG REGIO, 2016[4]).

They not only warned about spreading already limited human resources more thinly but also about duplicating effort. They also emphasised that not all such bodies are timely, regular or effective. Thus, often the need is not for a new dialogue body, but to use those that exist in ways that might better advance an MA’s coordination needs. This could mean expanding mandates or activities or adjusting agendas, for example. To manage dialogue fatigue is it is essential to be clear as to why the dialogue is being established before establishing it, the objectives for the dialogue, its expected results and next steps for action if relevant. It is also useful to identify and communicate beforehand if the dialogue mechanism is temporary and established for a specific purpose, or if it will be considered permanent. Rationalising existing dialogue bodies may occasionally be necessary, as well.

These can be a driving factor behind successful OPs and ROPs and investment results, particularly since subnational level authorities are most knowledgeable about regional specificities, investment needs and beneficiary capacities. In addition, they are well placed to identify overlaps and synergies between national and regional programming ex ante to ensure that actions are mutually supportive and build on each other. Late identification of overlap in objectives, project types and possible beneficiaries during the launch of programmes and project calls can lead to disputes in jurisdiction, responsibilities and beneficiaries, causing complications and delays. In regions with a smaller pool of potential beneficiaries, a lack of vertical coordination can result in a form of competition for funds offered by the region and those by other national programmes. Undertaking a joint national/regional analysis exercise could be useful to identify areas of potential programming complementarities and overlap. The results could be used to collaboratively establish programming that pursues complementary development objectives, limits (and ideally avoids) national/regional overlaps, and fills in programming gaps. “Hard” mechanisms, such as national-level requirements for distributing and using EU funds in regional public investment projects is one technique to ensure that ROPs are consistent with central priorities. An OECD case study on Wielkopolska, Poland reveals that local authority investment projects may be financed using EU funds on the condition that they contribute to the implementation of a multi-annual development strategy. The study highlights that, generally speaking, there is a positive impact on regional programme effectiveness and the sustainability of project financing when there is room for subnational governments to negotiate and influence conditions set by the national level. This experience suggests that conditions around which the two levels agree may work better than those imposed by one side or the other (OECD, 2013[22]). In addition, coordination with regional MAs or IBs may be insufficient among some MAs, due at least in part to administrative obstacles embedded in a bureaucratic approach to dialogue and information exchange.

Without good and timely communication among those responsible for OP implementation, large biases and information asymmetries may arise. To address this, building a stronger bottom-up approach to information and knowledge sharing as well as more targeted communications throughout the OP implementation system can be helpful. Good practices to manage information and knowledge gaps include those that create channels for clear and efficient information flows, as well as constant and regular knowledge sharing, be it among the different departments and units in an MA, between an MA and other bodies and authorities in the MCS, with other national and regional MAs in the country or abroad, or with beneficiaries and citizens. Currently, many MAs have participated in various networks to promote professional exchange on OP implementation processes (e.g. public procurement, evaluation, anti-fraud, risk management, etc.), which are deemed helpful for information exchange. This type of information and knowledge sharing could be furthered reinforced through regular opportunities and platforms for exchange across MAs in the EU. At the same time, it is important ensure the inclusiveness of these networks (i.e. the participation of operational-level staff and beneficiaries) and that the exchange outcomes contribute to the knowledge base for more effective OP management."},{"name": "1/2/4/index.html#p-d1e7399","text": "This pilot action highlighted that there is room for MAs to improve information flows and exchange throughout their OP programming and implementation system – generally by fostering greater consistency and fluidity of exchange, as well as ensuring that it is more timely and appropriately targeted.

For example, diverse stakeholders, and particularly beneficiaries, indicate information accessibility issues regarding the spectrum of support and funds available. Information on pros and cons, benefits and costs of using ESIF funds can be better clarified to beneficiaries, certainly for grants but especially for other, innovative financial instruments. In addition, introducing regular opportunities for two-way communication with IBs and beneficiaries regarding changes in regulations, processes or programmes might be helpful and contribute to reducing delays by enhancing capacity, especially at the beneficiary level. Ensuring regular and well-structured exchange with beneficiaries could offer additional insight into investment needs and the actual beneficiary capacity.

This can be particularly true with respect to two-way communication in hierarchical, top-down, or centralised administrative cultures. Within MAs, opportunities for different departments to meet, both at the department head and technical levels, can help keep information flowing across teams, and build institutional knowledge across sectors and activities. They also support a more transparent and accountable environment. Ensuring that such meetings happen on a formalised and regular basis (weekly, bi-monthly, monthly, etc.), with a clear agenda, free information exchange, articulated next steps or expectations, and responsibility for decision follow-up can smooth information flows and knowledge exchange throughout the OP investment process."},{"name": "1/2/4/index.html#p-d1e7415","text": "Easier information exchange and regular opportunities to exchange knowledge and good practices can also help actors involved in OP implementation share problems and jointly identify solutions.

Effective two-way information exchange is also necessary. Embedding multi-directional (i.e. top-down, bottom-up, and across departments) knowledge-sharing mechanisms and practices throughout an MCS is one way to accomplish this. MAs can support such knowledge-sharing by establishing better two-way exchange with their IBs, beneficiaries and other stakeholders through periodic but regular interaction. Such interaction can help identify and mitigate possible administrative, operational or investment risks. It can offer insight into the impact of an OP, a Priority Axis or an individual project, thereby providing the MA with valuable insight on what might work well, and where adjustments may be needed to improve the OP implementation processes.

In other words, communication that can answer the “what is in it for me” question that can arise, especially when engaging with funds is or is perceived to be lengthy and burdensome, without guarantee (i.e. beneficiaries may respond to a call but are not guaranteed to receive funds through the call if their project is not selected), or risky (e.g. a need to secure co-financing, or the possibility of financial corrections).

It is important that the communication approach and message resonate with different types of beneficiaries (e.g. small versus large municipalities; urban versus non-urban centres; micro and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) versus large enterprises; private versus academic research facilities, etc.), use simple, every-day language and be disseminated through various forms of media (e.g. print, newsletters, social media, digital or online networks, etc.).

This might be particularly useful in cases of large infrastructure investment, which can be disruptive and inconvenient for communities before the benefits are seen and appreciated. It would serve a dual purpose: first to explain the project and its objectives to community residents/citizens and second to highlight the role of EU funding in the project’s realisation. It can also provide citizens with insight into how projects implemented with EU funds work, what they have helped communities accomplish thus far, and what the MA and the local authority aim to achieve in the future with such programming. The development of a communication strategy should incorporate the opportunity for citizens to express their opinions and understanding of local investment needs, proposed project results, or EU funds in general. Surveys or public consultation events are a means to obtain such information. This is fundamental to help build trust in the process and serve as an accountability mechanism, particularly in those places where citizens are distrustful of co-financed interventions due to a lack of trust in legislation and a perception of favouritism in the award system. Citizen communication can be managed centrally, among MAs in the country, by an individual MA or can be developed in collaboration with individual communities to tailor messages specific to community interventions. Any communication however should use simple, every-day language and be disseminated through various forms of media (e.g. print, newsletters, social media, digital or online networks, etc.). It should also be managed strategically, for example through periodic analysis on comments and feedback from the public in order to adjust the communications plan as necessary. Such analysis can also highlight early-on where there may be dissatisfaction or disagreement with investment initiatives, and provide the implementing authorities with the opportunity to address citizen concerns, explaining why something may be necessary or, conversely why something cannot be done. This goes beyond the regulated communication programmes that each MA must have in place, and becomes a more strategic activity to build awareness of the role and importance of ESIF investment in the development and quality of life of a country, region, city, town, area, etc. In Portugal, authorities from different programmes associated with EU funds created a network of communicators and launched several ground-breaking campaigns, such as the “Have you heard of ... EU-funded project?”, disseminated by printing the question and name of the participating projects on five million sugar packets.

Reinforcing expertise and capacity is essential to help them manage the complexities linked to financing public investment with EU funds. One of the larger capacity gaps confronting beneficiaries is limitations in effective project design. For example, the 2015 OECD-CoR survey found that around two-third of subnational governments reported failure to take into account the full life cycle of infrastructure investment when designing projects (Allain-Dupré, Hulbert and Vincent, 2017[24]). This is significant, particularly given that subnational authorities often act as beneficiaries.

This means beneficiary support usually involves multiple departments, units and experts in the MA (or IBs), and beneficiaries may have difficulty in identifying the right interlocutor to help answer their questions. Ideally, a single point of contact is very helpful to address this problem, while also ensuring an efficient and user-friendly channel for beneficiaries to seek help. A single contact point can facilitate closer engagement and support between MAs/IBs and the beneficiaries through project development and delivery: from the development, assessment and approval of business plans, the ongoing monitoring of progress (reporting and meetings), and closing those projects. This practice has been adopted by many national and regional MAs, including in Slovenia (targeting enterprise beneficiaries), Malta (targeting the ICT-related investment priority, with a specific focus on providing information on various regulations), and Wales (targeting all OP beneficiaries) among others (European Commission, 2017[14]; Welsh European Funding Office, 2019, unpublished[18]; EU-Skladi, 2014[25]; Government of Malta, 2015[26]).

First, the heterogeneity of beneficiaries as a group, and the differences in their needs, resources and investment practices means that capacities will differ and capacity gaps may be extremely diverse. This makes offering tailored support potentially more resource intensive, and calls on a significant degree of flexibility in the capacity of MAs and IBs to offer such support. It requires that MAs and IBs develop a comprehensive understanding of their OP’s beneficiaries and their actual capacity at the start of a programming period.

Does the problem only exist among beneficiaries of a specific OP? In which case the relevant MA can address the matter. Or, is it a systemic issue requiring support from the national coordination body and a cooperative approach among all MAs? Then the question arises of how to reach beneficiaries in a coordinated and efficient manner as they may face similar difficulties. Is it through associations targeting a beneficiary type (e.g. associations of local authorities) or a specific investment sector (e.g. transport)? In most cases there is room for multiple bodies to contribute to the capacity building effort, but it must be clear who is responsible for which aspect. For example, many small municipalities may lack capacity in data collection and reporting. To address this problem, a data task force can be created with experts from the national statistical authorities or relevant units, MAs, and representatives from line ministries and municipalities to understand beneficiary difficulties and seek for solutions. It could also help identify incentive structures that would improve municipal data reporting.

MAs and IBs can also collaborate with other institutions to design and deliver these workshops. Making sure that current and future workshops or training programmes are well targeted is a basic step towards supporting beneficiaries. For example, the Croatia Agency for SMEs, Innovation and Investments (an IB) delivered a very fruitful stakeholder workshop focused on identifying the most common errors leading to irregularities. Ideally, such workshops should cover topics that the beneficiaries themselves highlight as important or of interest, such as regulatory issues, state aid, etc. There are a number of ways to obtain such information, including through direct communication with beneficiaries or through surveys carried out to identify the needs of the targeted groups.

For example, in Wales many ERDF programmes support investments in place-based infrastructure, e.g. tourism, business sites or other infrastructure assets that support regional development. Developing programmes that accomplish this involves a process of regional prioritisation through which projects are (or should be) prioritised by regional bodies, providing advice to the Welsh European Funding Office (WEFO) that also directly informs the relevant investment decisions (Welsh European Funding Office, 2019, unpublished[18]). Ownership of objectives and initiatives however, develops over time and through constant interaction between implementation authorities and external stakeholders, particularly beneficiaries. An EU report on increasing the engagement of partners in ESIF implementation pointed out that in some cases, while stakeholder engagement is formally implemented it does not allow for real participation in the governance process, potentially hampering the development of a sense of policy ownership on the ground (regionally and locally) (European Parliament, 2017[30]).

This is particularly true at the local authority level (Andreou, 2010[31]), as well as among beneficiaries that are SMEs. The second is to build ownership for OP-related projects among beneficiaries, including regional and local authorities. In the case of regional authorities, regional MAs can act in the interest of their regional OP and also as IBs for national OPs, and so they need to “buy-into” or “own” the objectives of the national OP and agree with the implementation process. In the case of local authorities, they not only face weak capacity, they also may face a citizenry (i.e. electoral base) that is sceptical of EU funds, often valuing other social or national funds for projects in their community.

The first challenge is low response to a project call due to call criteria (i.e. what types of projects are being called) that does not align with or reflect beneficiary capacities or needs. In other words, the project-call design does not simultaneously support the OP and beneficiaries. This can arise from insufficient consultation among the MA, IBs, and relevant sector bodies or other beneficiaries. Behind this issue may be a larger misalignment between Priority Axes and the realities of the beneficiary pool to which the funds are addressed (e.g. a Priority Axis that targets SME competitiveness or R&D and innovation may not fare well were the business eco-system does not support these). This can be a sector or thematic issue, or it can be a regional one.

Calls with short windows, that are competitively-structured, or that only come around once, can be confronted with limited response. This may be particularly true in smaller beneficiary pools– which may be more frequently the case in smaller countries or in certain types of regions. In some instances the window for the call itself may be insufficient for beneficiaries to complete the project application process on time due to limited project design capacity and/or documentation requirements that are ill-suited to the size of a project or size of a beneficiary (i.e. small projects with low values have the same documentation requirement as large projects of high value, although some of these requirements might be set at the EU or national level). In other cases, the problem is the same, but arises because beneficiaries are unaware of the call, or become aware very late in the call period.

This can occur if an MA schedules calls only to programming period’s mid-term, emphasising programme objectives in the mid-term perspective in order to be fully prepared for the mid-term review. Doing so allows for a certain degree of flexibility and helps the MA design subsequent calls that can reflect shifts in socio-economic conditions or changing priorities or needs. However, it can also lead to ineffective spending by allowing investment potential to accumulate in the market in a short period of time. If this happens and if beneficiary pools are small, there is the potential to create space for inflated cost projections given limited market competition and the market’s awareness that the MA itself is under pressure to spend. The result can be that the MA overpays for project implementation and at the same time reduces future spending capacity."},{"name": "1/2/4/index.html#p-d1e8115","text": "The impact of these various challenges are diverse. They can affect absorption rates across or within Priority Axes by creating an imbalance in the attractiveness (to beneficiaries) of initiatives within Priority Axes. They can also lead to an OP uptake mismatch across a territory, where some parts of a country or certain regions can take advantage of the opportunities offered and others cannot. This in the end can work against Cohesion Policy’s objective of reducing regional disparities. These challenges can also result in limited innovation among projects presented, particularly if call processes are short, which leaves less time for beneficiaries to design more innovative projects. Overall, the result is that ESIF financing for projects may be less attractive to certain targeted beneficiaries, which in turn affects MA absorption capacity. In general, a more strategic and flexible approach to call design processes may contribute to mitigating the impact of such challenges."},{"name": "1/2/4/index.html#p-d1e8121","text": "Improving communications channels for calls is another way to alleviate part of the problem. This means improving engagement with beneficiaries early in the investment cycle to ensure projects respond to needs and calls are structured in a way to hold broadest appeal, and building beneficiary capacity to respond to calls when they are launched. It can also mean communicating calls more effectively. Certainly, for example, through relevant websites, but also via social media, specific apps, business chamber meetings and professional associations or through universities and NGO networks depending on beneficiary types, eligibility criteria, etc. Developing, publishing and disseminating a ‘call calendar’ for better call predictability can also be an effective and clear communication tool for IBs and beneficiaries to make sure calls to reach all possible applicants. This can be an online calendar which centralises all calls for proposal for a specified period of time (e.g. upcoming 1-2 years) with a minimum number of days/weeks prior to application deadlines required for announcing adjustments or changes. A “deeper” approach to addressing the problem can be in the form of a pilot initiative to test new avenues for call processes and project selection. This can include working with an MA’s Monitoring Committee, stakeholders and beneficiaries to set project parameters, testing new channels to communicate calls, defining eligibility criteria that reflects project size, beneficiary type (e.g. local authority versus private sector) and capacity; adjusting call typologies by extending the duration of a call, increasing the number of open calls, or launching non-competitive calls for certain projects or beneficiary types."},{"name": "1/2/4/index.html#p-d1e8138","text": "One fundamental operational problem that many, if not all, MAs face is the carrying forward of projects from one programming period to the next. The extension of projects, and recourse to the N+3 rule is understandable, particularly given the complexity and duration of certain initiatives, especially those that involve large infrastructure projects, as well as other delays that may originate at the project or beneficiary level. However, carrying over projects from a previous programming period can delay starting projects in the new programming period, and can exert an additional burden on an MA and its IBs.

At the European-level, timely adoption of regulations can better support timely drafting, negotiation and approval of programming documents. At a national level, it is important that the Partnership Agreement is in place with sufficient time for MAs and OPs to be designated and operational as early into the period as possible. At the same time, a pipeline of ready projects should be in place so that once the new period is launched, programmes/projects can get underway as rapidly as possible. In addition, MAs can and should continue to ensure effective risk management and the early identification of projects at risk of implementation problems throughout the investment cycle. Effective and continual risk management is one way to manage this challenge. The Greek MA for the OP Transport Infrastructure, Environment and Sustainable Development has introduced a number of risk management tools for the 2014-2020 programming period. These include the OP Risk Assessment, the Project Risk Assessment and the Fraud Risk Assessment. The OP Risk Assessment tool is an “umbrella” tool, that is applied annually or every two years. The Project Risk Assessment is bi-annually applied and its results are one of the parameters that define on-the-spot-verifications each semester.

While this can take time to ascertain, it is unclear whether existing monitoring and evaluation systems are used in such a way to facilitate the exercise, or if there is an intention to do so.

Time is another factor, as results may be measurable only after several months or years. The current system focuses on financial and technical indicators, with limited attention to measuring and evaluating strategic outcomes. A number of factors may be behind this. First, indicator systems may be out of date or not suitable to measure project impact and OP outcomes. Indicators should be relevant – in this case linked to both OP and national objectives – valid, reliable, and useful. They should also be clear, and manageable in number. Indicators that are imprecise and/or too many in number do not support effective analysis and evaluation, and can limit the ability to capture performance that is within the control of the MA in the timeframe being measured (OECD, 2019[7]). Second, the relationship between inputs, outputs, and outcomes may not be sufficiently clear and measurable to those who need to provide the information. The problem should be addressed at the early stage of project or programme development – for example, project applicants for ESIF in Denmark are required to describe the chain of effects of their projects in contributing to the Priority Axis or OP objectives, which is intended to provide a good basis for evaluation (Polverari, 2014[38]). Third, there may be limited capacity, incentive or perceived need for more robust indicators and undertaking outcome-oriented monitoring and evaluation exercises. At the MA level, this can require strengthening the quality and use of indicators and performance measurement practices. At the beneficiary level, there may be resource or other constraints limited in data collection and reporting.

Strictly quantitative data gathering can be complemented with qualitative mechanisms that offer insight into results and impact. These can include surveys, opinion surveys, focus group research, and evaluation studies, for example. In Poland’s Lubelskie region, a series of long term results indicators associated with ESF are measured by evaluation studies. A manual was developed to clarify definitions and measurement methods for all indicators in the national guidelines, and it is regularly updated in response to beneficiary comments regarding the clarity of definitions or problems with measurement that may arise as projects are implemented. Finally, there is also an established methodology to use project indicators to determine the impact of projects on strategic/programme objectives. These in turn are verified as part of impact evaluations forming the Lubelskie ROP Evaluation Plan for 2014-2020. MAs from different OPs could pool resources to carry out such qualitative studies to generate insight into results and the impact of ESIF investment in their country overall, as well as with respect to their OP.

If poorly designed, unstable, or improperly explained or understood, framework conditions can negatively affect investment processes and results, causing unnecessary delays and increasing project costs.

EU-level regulations govern the allocation and use of European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), including control, verification, monitoring and audit processes. These can change significantly over successive programming periods and are consistently perceived as complex by MAs and other Operational Programme (OP) stakeholders. MAs, Intermediate Bodies (IBs), beneficiaries and other OP stakeholders participating in this pilot action generally cited EU regulations as one of the leading impediments to more efficient and/or effective ESIF investment processes. In addition, EU Member States establish their own national regulations governing the management of EU funds in their territory. These regulations can vary according to country context, institutional parameters, and level of government. MCS, usually established by the bodies responsible for managing EU funds in an EU Member State, can differ according to national governance practices. Thus, while EU regulations are consistent across Member States, national-level frameworks and MCS vary from country to country, each characterised by different levels of stability and complexity, rendering ESIF implementation easier for some MAs than for others."},{"name": "1/2/5/index.html#p-d1e9392","text": "With the exception of public procurement frameworks, in general the greatest difficulties seem to be not in the existence of framework conditions themselves (there is general agreement that rules, regulations and standards can be valuable), but rather in their characteristics. Top among the challenges highlighted in this pilot project involved national legislative/regulatory practices for ESIF and associated administrative burden; a lack of clarity and/or a lack of consistency in interpreting rules or practices surrounding controls, verifications and audits; and difficulties working within public procurement parameters. Combined, these can generate excessive administrative burden, instability and uncertainty in the investment process, which in turn affects absorption capacity. This can lead to a risk that resources are not deployed in the most effective and efficient manner. For example, MAs may tend to focus on complying with regulations and take a risk-adverse approach when designing calls, or selecting and assessing projects. In addition, there is the potential to lose sight of overall objectives, and cause unnecessary delays and increased project costs."},{"name": "1/2/5/index.html#p-d1e9396","text": "It is important to recall that many, if not all, framework conditions take time to change and are outside of an MA’s direct control. In light of this, the European Commission has acknowledged that framework conditions pose challenges and has made moves towards greater simplification for the post-2020 programming period. Thus, the discussion below intends simply to highlight the main issues and their implications. It should be noted, however, that some MAs do take matters to hand and play an active role in proposing amendments of relevant legal and regulatory frameworks, putting pressure where it is needed when red tape appears to be causing significant problems in OP implementation. Many MAs are also quick to respond and offer guidance to beneficiaries seeking clarifications on legal frameworks, as well as finding ways to communicate how other beneficiaries addressed similar obstacles. Overall, with respect to framework conditions, MAs and other parties must work together to set realistic and effective parameters and proactively manage difficulties as quickly and efficiently as possible. It is also important to consider active consultation with MAs when designing the framework conditions that structure their work."},{"name": "1/2/5/index.html#p-d1e9408","text": "Stakeholders across different MAs tend to consider that the rules and regulations associated with OP implementation – be they stemming from the EU, from the national government or part of the MCS – can be unclear, unstable, excessive, and generate unnecessary administrative burden for OP implementation. European-level regulations and requirements, which are complicated, are often incorporated into national legislation, adding another layer of complexity, reducing the room for manoeuvre and potentially increasing red tape. Simplifying procedures is crucial to promote effective public investment, in particular where capacities are low, a point that the European Commission is reinforcing through greater simplification in the next programming period. An excessive amount of legislation and guidance or the proliferation of multiple conditions coupled with weak capacities can lead to inefficient investment. Moreover, administrative burden combined with unequal capacities within countries, risk deepening pre-existing inequalities (OECD, 2018[2]). Pilot MAs report difficulties arising from unclear, complex or frequently changing legislation, as well as a “one-size-fits-all” approach to programming requirements."},{"name": "1/2/5/index.html#p-d1e9428","text": "A lack of clarity and a high degree of complexity in the rules governing ESIF use, be they EU or national-level rules, is a common theme brought up among OP stakeholders in each participating country. MAs in some countries note that in order to counter any uncertainty, different national control bodies respond by introducing new or additional control activities for ESIF, often stricter than those established in EU or national regulations. This can generate more administrative burden for the MAs, and higher transaction costs for IB and beneficiaries. One of the causes of complexity identified by MAs and other OP-implementing authorities is the untimely and fragmented provision of EU guidance, which further leads to legal uncertainty and ambiguity (Ferry and Polverari, 2018[3]). For example, designation procedures (i.e. ensuring that the MA and CA have the necessary and appropriate MCS set up) are considered by some MAs the most complex tasks in ESIF management for this programming period (Figure 5.1). Initially in this period, the European Commission intended to simplify these procedures by allowing Member States to carry out the designation without direct Commission review. However, in practice, following the various guidance and checklists from the European Commission increased the workload of Member States. In addition, Member States tend to establish a ‘heavy’ procedure to guarantee compliance and limit the scope of retroactive audit measures. The implication is that MAs, national authorities and the European Commission (EC) need to work together to find the right balance between systems that are sufficiently rigorous to detect irregularities and yet not too demanding or complex for administrations (Ferry and Polverari, 2018[3])."},{"name": "1/2/5/index.html#figure-d1e9453","text": "Complexities facing MAs in the 2014-2020 programming periodComplexities facing MAs in the 2014-2020 programming period"},{"name": "1/2/5/index.html#p-d1e9474","text": "Note: This is the survey result from 15 MA staff from seven different OPs.

They require an on-going effort to interpret and understand potential impact, especially as such changes can lead to increasingly complex controls in order to avoid financial corrections. There are different reasons behind such changes. For example, they can arise if policies and rules are insufficiently robust and need to be adjusted; due to political influence or political change; or they can be the result of limited learning opportunities and/or insufficient evidence of regulatory or policy effectiveness, with decisions taken well before the conclusion of an expenditure cycle (Crescenzi and Giua, 2016[4])."},{"name": "1/2/5/index.html#p-d1e9506","text": "In some countries, eligibility rules can change midway through a project implementation cycle, and the new rules will apply to already-approved projects (rather than “grandfathering” the old rules). In Romania, for example, stakeholders strongly criticised frequent changes to national-level procedures and documentation by the government as a practice of “changing the rules during the game”. Such changes, although often necessary, had strong implications for the management of the funding and frequently triggered other unforeseen problems (Surubaru, 2017[5]). In other instances, line ministries may change their sectoral strategies every two or three years, or with the entry of a new government, which can then affect investment priorities at the OP level. In some MAs, OPs are linked to sectoral budget plans instead of overall sectoral strategies, or national budgets, or as part of an overall national ESIF budget line, when possible. This, too, can affect the stability of OP implementation, for instance if sector budgets are annual with limited year to year forecasting, or if circumstances generate limited budget predictability and severe adjustments, and/or if the MA depends on line ministries for co-financing. Single budget lines for ESIF can be helpful in this respect. In addition, greater recourse to financial instruments, in line with the European Commission recommendations, may also be valuable, though MA and beneficiary capacity to better capitalise on the opportunities afforded by using financial instruments may need to be built."},{"name": "1/2/5/index.html#p-d1e9525","text": "Frequent changes can also generate additional administrative work and insecurity (i.e. the possibility of financial corrections), which may lead to delays and can potentially discourage beneficiaries from responding to calls due to limited appeal of ESIF co-financed projects.

By creating additional uncertainty and room for error in the project implementation process, such changes affect the consistency, stability and certainty that supports effective OP implementation and ESIF investment."},{"name": "1/2/5/index.html#p-d1e9529","text": "Such changes, especially those relating to regulation and legislation, also affect beneficiaries; and contributes to the ongoing need for effective and clear communication regarding changes and their practical implications, as well as support to properly implement them.

Regular opportunities for training at the technical and expert level – i.e. among those most involved in applying and explaining the rules – is fundamental. This can be in the form of hands-on workshops where staff learn how to better understand/interpret and apply new rules and regulations, for example. Such learning opportunities should be offered regularly and ideally tailored to different MA departments, as well regional MAs, IBs and beneficiaries. Establishing a working group or network of OP stakeholders (ideally across MAs) to act as a consultative body that can evaluate the impact of proposed legislative changes governing the use of ESIF could help identify potential difficulties in interpretation."},{"name": "1/2/5/index.html#p-d1e9545","text": "Many MAs and OP stakeholders in this pilot project described approaches to the regulatory framework for ESIF as “inflexible”. While this may be inherent to the concept of regulations in general, it can depend on how they are designed, and when greater or lesser degrees of flexibility may be appropriate. What was evident in many cases is a “one-size-fits-all” approach to the rules governing administration and management procedures for project implementation. In more than one case, these are set without distinguishing between project type, sector or size (e.g. ERDF vs ESF, environment vs infrastructure, large and long term vs small and quick, high value versus modest value, etc.)."},{"name": "1/2/5/index.html#p-d1e9549","text": "Generally speaking, OPs demand the same amount and type of documentation and licenses, number of approvals, and obligations for large, long-term and expensive projects as it does for small, short-term and less expensive ones, or regardless of the size of the beneficiary (e.g. a large company versus an SME, or a metropolitan area or Integrated Territorial Investment (ITI) versus a small, remote local authority). While this standardisation can facilitate higher-level management, control, and coordination, it leaves little room for an MA’s operational and implementation levels to tailor responses to specific challenges. It can lead to an ineffective use of already tight resources, as small projects demand the same amount of time and attention as larger ones that may have greater economic and development impact. In addition, there is the potential to lose sight of overall objectives, and cause unnecessary delays and increased project costs – particularly difficult for small projects with limited resources. This is a particularly significant issue for MAs whose OPs can involve multiple sectors or themes and projects of fundamentally different natures. One option is to introduce a greater degree of proportionality in checks and controls placed on projects based on the level of associated risk."},{"name": "1/2/5/index.html#p-d1e9553","text": "In the 2021-2027 programme period, more cross-sector and integrated programmes, measures and projects are expected. Introducing greater flexibility or room for MAs to adjust the procedures according to projects and beneficiaries could help further strengthen the integrated approach in OP implementation. This may require adjustments to the MCS. For countries that might consider this, to determine whether recalibration of the system is necessary and ensure that adjustments promote an improved system, consultation with MAs, IBs and beneficiaries is fundamental for determining perceptions and needs regarding greater flexibility."},{"name": "1/2/5/index.html#p-d1e9557","text": "Bringing MAs together with other key authorities to identify, discuss, adjust and solve matters inherent to the MCS could prove valuable. For example, in Greece, the National Coordination Authority is planning to introduce a Management and Control System Network to help address some of the rigidities in the MCS and in regulatory frameworks that affect all Greek MAs. This kind of network could serve as an information/experience sharing platform, as well as a consultative forum for MAs on critical matters such as system amendments, legal framework amendments and their impact, etc."},{"name": "1/2/5/index.html#p-d1e9561","text": "The impact of such a network could be boosted by the creation of an EU-wide network of MAs and coordinating bodies, sponsored by the EC, and open to national and regional level MAs. An EU-level network could serve as a powerful forum for information and knowledge exchange among MAs, discussion of common problems, identification of potential solutions, and sharing of good practices that could then be adapted and applied by MAs to their own country contexts. It could also be a useful source of information and a coordination mechanism for the EU as well, particularly when it is preparing strategy documents and programming initiatives."},{"name": "1/2/5/index.html#p-d1e9573","text": "Administrative burden and excessive red tape is a central challenge to effective investment (OECD, forthcoming[6]; OECD, 2018[2]), and one that MAs, IBs and beneficiaries consistently emphasised during this pilot project. ESIF investment rules and control activities that change often or which are excessively strict can result in higher day-to-day administrative burden for the MA and greater transaction costs for the IBs and beneficiaries, particularly if the rules adopted impose new, additional or more stringent requirements. For example, it is not unheard of for contracting authorities, and sometimes other control bodies, to require not only the necessary documentation per European directives, but also documentation requested in national legislative framework(s), and additional supporting documents to further verify the projects (including, on occasion, documentation that was relevant in past periods). This intensification of bureaucracy, while on the one hand potentially trying to minimise the possibility of financial corrections, on the other substantially increases the workload/management cost for everyone in the system – from the MA to beneficiaries – and particularly in sectors where there are many small projects. Ultimately, the result is lower OP implementation efficiency. If taken to an extreme, it also can mean less absorption due to a system that discourages investors (e.g. private sector) from applying to co-financed project opportunities given the associated transaction costs. MAs have some tools available to them to help streamline processes and alleviate the administrative burden in daily operations. Bulgaria, for example, introduced the electronic tendering and e-monitoring of public contracts systems in 2017. The central purchasing body in Italy, Consip S.p.A, defined a framework contracts for the ESIF programmes, to standardise and centralise the process for all MAs, CAs and AAs, as well as IBs, to request and select expert support services and technical assistance (Consip, 2016[7])."},{"name": "1/2/5/index.html#p-d1e9603","text": "For the 2021-2027 programming period, the European Commission has proposed several reforms aiming to reduce administrative burden in ESIF implementation. These include establishing one single rulebook, the Common Provisions Framework, to cover all ESIF management; reducing the number of TOs to enable synergies and flexibility between various strands within a given objective; streamlining and reordering ex ante conditionalities according to their priority level; as well as simplifying access to funds for beneficiaries through fewer rules and lighter control procedures (European Policies Research Centre, 2019[8]). In addition, the European Commission is proposing that Simplified Costs Options be applied to small projects. Doing so would permit OP authorities and beneficiaries to agree on a specific budget and expected outcomes on a case-by-case basis and increase support of smaller projects. If well-implemented, these initiatives could have significant potential in reducing administrative costs and introducing greater flexibility for MAs and other authorities in ESIF management, as well as for beneficiaries (European Training Centre in Paris, 2018[9])."},{"name": "1/2/5/index.html#p-d1e9634","text": "The procedures and guidelines for OP project selection, control and verification, and audits appear to be open to a degree of interpretation. This creates uncertainties with respect to eligibility criteria among project applicants, complicates the application process and affects monitoring and control mechanisms. The problem can be particularly acute with respect to control and audit activities. The problem arises when a controller interprets an application or procurement process in one way (e.g. nothing wrong), and a subsequent controller in another point of the monitoring and control process interprets it in another (e.g. something is incorrect). In some OPs, there are reportedly up to eight controls for large European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) projects, entailing a high likelihood of different control results. This type of uncertainty contributes to insecurity among beneficiaries, adds to the administrative burden of the MA (as each point of control can require additional documentation), and can result in financial corrections that may be highly onerous, particularly for smaller beneficiaries with small budgets and/or limited liquidity for project implementation. Ultimately, inconsistency in control processes can lead to delays, affect absorption, and limit the attractiveness of ESIF co-financing for beneficiaries. Different interpretations in audits also contribute to the lack of clarity, or degree of unpredictability, associated with project implementation. The problem that arises in audits is similar to the one described for monitoring and control processes: audit approaches (and sometimes findings) can differ by auditor or by on-the-spot verification teams."},{"name": "1/2/5/index.html#p-d1e9638","text": "To reach a satisfactory level of certainty within an MCS’s monitoring and verification process, instructions regarding all main issues/risks should be clear and easy to understand, free from vagueness or ambiguity, based on specific regulations as well as general guidelines. This may call for an agreed upon approach between the European Commission and Member States regarding a number of specific challenging issues requiring further clarification, in order to attain common understanding between all relevant stakeholders [i.e. beneficiaries, MA, national coordinating bodies, Certifying Authority (CA), and Audit Authority (AA)]. Doing so could permit parties to request the same evidence and reach the same conclusions upon specific issues, regardless of where within the MCS the control, verification or audit is being carried out. A consistent interpretation of rules by EU and national level auditors and evaluators and clear and agreed upon interpretation guidelines established among them, may be one step towards mitigating the problem. Nevertheless, after having clearly defined the interpretation on crucial topics and having arrived at a common understanding, the need to adapt to new guidelines should be expected from time to time."},{"name": "1/2/5/index.html#p-d1e9642","text": "There are number of activities that could be undertaken to help minimise the incidence or impact of an inconsistent interpretation of rules and regulations for control, verification or audit purposes. For example, annual meetings of an EU Member State’s national coordinating body for EU funds, its CA and AA could be organised in order to share experience and information, and formulate/promote a common understanding on specific cases. Incorporating MA perspectives and/or proposals in the preparation of such meetings (e.g. agenda setting) could be useful. It should be noted that such meetings are not intended to compromise the independence of the institutions involved, particularly in terms of undertaking their activities and reporting relevant findings. Rather, the aim is to gather as much expertise and perspective as possible to identify what is and what is not possible in specific cases.

It could be composed of representatives from national (and regional where appropriate) audit bodies that could set interpretation standards, promote consistency for how rules are interpreted, establish who is responsible for auditing what, and avoid audit overlapping, ideally helping build stability and predictability into the system. If such a committee already exists at a national level, then consideration should be given to establishing a working group or sub-committee dedicated to establishing and agreeing upon a standard set of interpretations for ESIF project selection and control processes, and setting an audit plan that could be published and disseminated among stakeholders. While the upfront resource commitment may be high, in the medium to long run greater consistency and predictability in how rules are interpreted could help minimise problems, translating into greater stability in OP implementation and contributing to more efficient fund absorption."},{"name": "1/2/5/index.html#p-d1e9653","text": "At a minimum and if not already done, a reference of “control and audit precedents” should be published (electronically and/or on paper) and available to all stakeholders (e.g. IBs, beneficiaries, consultants, etc.).

Improving the quality and reliability of public procurement systems can foster large savings: even a 1% efficiency gain could generate a savings of approximately EUR 20 billion per year in the EU (European Commission, 2019[10]). At the same time, procurement practices represent one of the largest framework challenges for MAs and beneficiaries alike. In many instances, particularly among smaller beneficiaries, there may be limited capacity in terms of resources and technical knowledge to effectively participate in and/or manage procurement processes (OECD, 2019[1]). Poor procurement practices, unclear or often-changing procurement laws, or lengthy procurement processes can all impede the effective implementation of ESIF projects. When these are combined with limited institutional capacity, inadequate knowledge of good procurement practices, or insufficient human resources to deal with procurement procedures, there is significant margin for procurement processes to lead to higher transaction costs and financial adjustments in the case of EU funds."},{"name": "1/2/5/index.html#p-d1e9685","text": "Procurement legislation is often complex and subject to constant updates and adjustments in order to address new issues and circumstances.

Keeping up with the changes, understanding their implications and how to apply them, then communicating these to IBs and beneficiaries, and actively helping ensure compliance is a fundamental yet resource intensive task of the MAs. Ensuring compliance, however, can be more difficult due to room for legal interpretation, particularly when the law is unclear or frequently changed. The Commission, under the coordination of DG REGIO, has developed the Guidance for practitioners on the avoidance of the most common errors in public procurement of projects funded by the European Structural and Investment Funds (2018[11]), which MAs and other authorities in the MCS can consult.

It was observed that pilot MAs often propagated the legalistic culture of public sector organisations by only implementing changes mandated through legislation and regulations. In general, however, public sector legislation leaves some room for managerial discretion, the challenge is to find it and use it in ways that encourage innovative thinking. Often what is most needed is internal discussion, consensus and agreement to pilot a new approach, something that MAs may not always feel empowered to initiate.

National level authorities – be they Centres of Government, ministries of finance, of public administration, of regional development, or national coordinating bodies for EU funds – have a key role to play in effective ESIF investment and ensuring the solid administrative capacities of their MAs. It appears, however, that actors often place substantial emphasis on planning how funds should be spent and ensuring compliance with regulations and guidelines and relatively less time taking a more strategic focus on implementation and outcomes. The impact of administrative capacity-building or other support actions may be lost when designed and implemented individually by MAs rather than in broad concertation. In many cases, MAs sit in different ministries from where projects are actually implemented, and therefore their influence can be weakened unless the “implementing ministries” are aware of potential differences in policy and proactively support MAs in their work. In addition, addressing many of the challenges and implementing the potential solutions identified by the pilot MAs with respect to their ESIF administrative and investment management capacity requires support or action taken by national bodies beyond the MA’s organisational structure. Thus, without adequate support, it can be difficult to implement identified capacity building actions, especially in very siloed or hierarchical structures, unless higher-level actors actively promote a strategic partnership with and among their MAs, and between MAs and beneficiaries."},{"name": "1/2/6/index.html#p-d1e10834","text": "There are a number of issues explored in this pilot that require higher-level support and action in order to be addressed.

Structures and processes that facilitate ESIF administration are designed to minimise risk and mitigate the potential for fraud or error. This is sensible. However, a potential downside to such a risk-averse approach is that MA leadership and staff at operational levels have little incentive to test new approaches. Moving into a new programming period, it would be opportune for national bodies to work with MAs and consider how and where to encourage experimentation and innovation within the bounds of existing – and proposed – legislation and regulations. It would be useful to involve the European Commission in such deliberations, as well. Giving MAs more autonomy to innovate could be a first step to testing potential good practices. For example, if an MA wishes to trial a new way of recruiting staff, there should be scope to trial it under certain time-bound conditions, on a small scale and with appropriate care given to monitoring and evaluating. Successful approaches could be well documented and scaled to other MAs in the MCS and throughout the EU. Risk-aversion can characterise an MA’s approach to project selection and appraisals, as well, as there is often is a tendency to apply funds in ways that mirror past use rather than taking a longer-term more strategic approach. The support for greater innovation in MA operations can also trickle down to beneficiaries, for example by encouraging them to develop investment projects that may be (slightly) more innovative."},{"name": "1/2/6/index.html#p-d1e10844","text": "Building the administrative capacity of Managing Authorities should be undertaken at the appropriate scale. While much can be done by individual MAs to boost their administrative capacity, there is also a need to consider which actions and initiatives are more effective (i.e. have greater impact) when applied at a higher-level. For example, many of the actions contained in the Roadmaps developed through this pilot may be better leveraged at the MCS level than at the individual MA level, as the implementation could be easier and have greater impact. In this respect, it will be important for national coordination bodies and others to be active partners in the development of Roadmaps and plans given the limitations for individual MAs to build administrative capacity. In some cases, it may be beneficial to coordinate the future development of MA Roadmaps with higher-level bodies (e.g. national coordination bodies). This could help balance stakeholder roles and responsibilities, and encourage synergies and economies of scale for some initiatives that could be implemented and coordinated across multiple MAs. Care should be taken to ensure that such coordination occurs at an appropriate level based on the type of MA – national or regional for example."},{"name": "1/2/6/index.html#p-d1e10850","text": "Reconsidering the approach to national-level regulations and laws governing ESIF could boost timely investment implementation. Frequently changing regulations governing the use of ESIF can create an unstable investment environment and dissuade potential beneficiaries (particularly in the private sector) from tapping into the funds. The five pilots also showed how these changes were often not well managed in MAs, and therefore created heavy work burdens that slowed processes and reduced organisational productivity. In addition, rules or regulations for ESIF-use that go over and above what is established in EU regulations or national status add to administrative complexity and burden, and can compound the uncertainty associated with controls, verifications and audits. Such uncertainty may also discourage beneficiaries from responding to calls or designing innovative projects. While regulatory changes may be necessary during a programming period, minimising the need would be optimal, and consideration could be given to “grandfathering” rules or regulations for projects already in the OP implementation system, i.e. only applying changes to new projects calls."},{"name": "1/2/6/index.html#p-d1e10856","text": "There is room to re-evaluate and possibly recalibrate the institutional arrangements for MCS, and Monitoring Committees to make them more fit-for-purpose. The MCS provides the architecture for MA and OP operations. If it is too complex, too rigid, or inappropriate for implementing a particular OP, it can limit an MA’s capacity to do its job. It appears that a significant amount of the administrative burden associated with ESIF stems either from EU or national regulations, or from the MCS in its effort to avoid financial corrections. With respect to project implementation processes, for example, MAs highlight that often the same amount and type of documentation is required of projects regardless of size, value or scope. While the standardisation facilitates higher-level management, there is little room for MAs to tailor responses to specific challenges. Consideration could be given to introducing a greater degree of proportionality in checks and controls, and/or to permitting MAs to adjust procedures according to project size or beneficiary type. This could be developed with a cap or ceiling, permitting MAs to adjust procedures for projects up to a certain value. More generally, bringing MAs together with other key authorities in an MA/MCS dialogue forum or network to identify, discuss, adjust and solve matters inherent to the MCS could be beneficial for all actors, and support taking a more systemic approach to meeting OP and Partnership Agreement objectives. For such dialogue to be genuinely fruitful, however, it requires a shift in mentality about the role of MAs from simply an issuer of guidance or an implementing body to one that can genuinely push for change and take follow-up action. MAs can (and should) use their convening power to consult with stakeholders – within the MCS and beyond, including beneficiaries – to discuss their difficulties and the concrete tools that could support change, including Roadmaps for administrative capacity building."},{"name": "1/2/6/index.html#p-d1e10862","text": "The need for re-consideration and re-calibration also extends to the practical engagement of the Monitoring Committees.

Their role as a multi-stakeholder forum could be boosted, as could their role in providing “practitioner” or “on the ground” insight into investment needs and priority setting. In addition, they could actively contribute to project selection and support qualitative (and even quantitative) monitoring and evaluation, and to provide input into reporting if they do not already, taking appropriate care to manage potential conflicts of interest. All of this, however, may require reconsidering the Committees, their objectives, structure, and size in order to more effectively deploy them in the ESIF strategic implementation process and support MAs in the management of their OPs."},{"name": "1/2/6/index.html#p-d1e10868","text": "Greater participation and input from MAs in strategic and operational considerations could be more actively sought or encouraged.

National authorities may need to work together with national coordinating bodies and MAs to better understand the challenges and identify solutions or common interpretations that facilitate operational improvements and problem solving. In all cases, it is important to ensure that MA perspectives are incorporated into decision-making, as they have strong insight into what is practical and what is not, and how certain changes impact operational delivery.

On the one hand, MA staff broadly felt that the European Commission was not always fully aware of the day-to-day challenges they faced in administering ESIF. On the other, the European Commission felt that existing tools available to address some of these issues – such as peer exchange through the TAIEX Peer-to-Peer tool and the Competency Framework – were not yet being utilised to their full potential. Thought may need to be given as to how to narrow this gap. More targeted or more frequent formal and informal dialogue to help national and regional MAs address implementation challenges as they arise, could be valuable. To this point, and as noted in Chapter 4, MAs value informal dialogue in their relationship with the European Commission. A large majority of them find it very useful not only for understanding new requirements but also for the opportunity it affords to give feedback. There is scope, therefore, to complement the formal guidance provided by the European Commission, with increased interaction between its representatives responsible for programming, rules and regulations and the MAs in order to understand the practical challenges MAs face. It is important to ensure that exchange is reinforced at operational levels, i.e. with MA staff who are closest to day-to-day challenges, just as it should occur between senior DG REGIO staff and MA leadership."},{"name": "1/2/6/index.html#p-d1e10905","text": "National authorities could be further encouraged to consult Managing Authorities in designing the MCS and the processes required to implement OPs.

While the European Commission does not control these activities or impose strict rules on how national administrations regulate or structure ESIF management, including for MCS, it does establish the regulatory framework and guidelines for OP implementation bodies (MAs, CAs, and AAs). To make the most of the practical knowledge in MAs, such guidelines could further encourage that national authorities to consult MAs when transposing EU guidelines into national regulations or operational frameworks (e.g. the MCS). Incorporating the MA perspective could offer a practical dimension to how such frameworks may operate in practice and contribute to reducing unnecessary red tape.

The OECD then sent a questionnaire and request for key documents/policies/legislation to each MA. Reviewing this material allowed the OECD team to develop initial hypotheses on possible challenges facing the MAs. These hypotheses were tested during a week-long mission to each MA carried out between September 2018 and January 2019. The missions were structured around an intensive series of semi-structured interviews with people from across the MA at leadership and operational levels, as well as with representatives from other bodies involved in the Management and Control System (MCS), such as Intermediary Bodies (IBs), beneficiaries, and members of the Monitoring Committee."},{"name": "1/3/1/index.html#p-d1e10998","text": "The missions concluded with a day-long workshop where preliminary conclusions were presented to staff from across the MCS. The purpose was to use these conclusions as the basis for an extensive SWOT analysis by all the participants at the workshop. The first half of the workshop focused on developing the SWOT around several themes that emerged from the series of interviews – people strategy, strategic planning, etc. – and the second half focussed on developing potential solutions to these issues. As noted above, the OECD analytical framework was applied at each stage of the missions to structure questions and contextualise responses."},{"name": "1/3/1/index.html#p-d1e11002","text": "Following the missions, the OECD developed a draft Roadmap of administrative capacity-building actions for each MA, supported by a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses supporting these suggestions.

The OECD revised the Roadmaps based on feedback received at this meeting, and developed a final draft version to use as a basis for discussion during a second round of missions intended to finalise and validate the Roadmaps."},{"name": "1/3/1/index.html#p-d1e11006","text": "The Roadmaps were finalised in July 2019 and implementation of selected administrative capacity-building actions is expected to begin in January 2020.
