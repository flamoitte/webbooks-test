Successfully managing and administering these funds rests on the effective governance of the investment process, on the administrative capacity of Managing Authorities, and on the capacities of a diverse range of stakeholders. The management of ESIF involves a complex ecosystem of actors – from multiple levels of government, to private firms and non-profit entities. Clear, evidence-based strategies are essential to intelligently direct ESIF to where they are most needed and likely to have a positive impact; effective co-ordination and communication among actors, including beneficiaries, is necessary to ensure the maximum impact from the use of the Funds; and having the right skills and capacities is core to good project management. This can prove challenging.

"Given rising investment needs and declining public investment spending, European Union (EU) funding mechanisms represent an important tool to ensure investment spending among EU Member States. In the current 2014-2020 programming period, EUR 461 billion was allocated to the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). National co-financing brings the total to EUR 647 billion available for ESIF investment in the European Union. Given the breadth and importance of ESIF, making the most of the opportunities it offers rests on ensuring quality institutions and administrative capacities as well as effective governance and management mechanisms."},{"name": "https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/index.html#p-d1e615","text": "Administrative capacities matter for the effectiveness and impact of ESIF. In particular, quality governance practices, institutions and institutional practices can positively affect the returns to Cohesion Policy investment, regional competitiveness and economic growth. Thus, it is essential to invest in governance, to build adequate capabilities to manage EU funds among all levels of government, and to design strong investment strategies. These concepts are key tenets of the OECD Recommendation of Effective Public Investment across Levels of Government. Ahead of the 2021-2027 programming period, the European Commission launched a pilot project to support ESIF Managing Authorities (MAs) in the development of Roadmaps aimed at strengthening their administrative capacities to effectively oversee, administer and evaluate the use of ESIF. Five MAs were selected by DG REGIO to participate in this project – three at the national level and two at the regional level. The findings in this report draw from the project undertaken with these five MAs. From this selected group, MAs throughout the ESIF management system may recognise similar challenges, and the lessons are broadly applicable not only to EU Member State Managing Authorities, but to public sector institutions charged with designing and implementing investment strategies and seeking to strengthen their capacities to do so."},{"name": "https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/index.html#p-d1e626","text": "Each MA in the pilot displayed specific challenges relating to diverse issues, including local market conditions, distinct governance structures and the precise combinations of thematic objectives. Despite the individual characteristics of each MA, including size, territorial scope (national or regional), level of expertise in ESIF management, etc., common threads in terms of challenges, experiences, needs and (occasionally) solutions, emerged throughout the diagnostic phase and in stakeholder interviews. Although each MA is affected to different degrees by the challenges listed below, a key observation of this project is that all five of the MAs – and most likely more beyond this sample – will recognise elements of these challenges that apply to them."},{"name": "https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/index.html#p-d1e637","text": "MAs generally have skilled and professional staff, but these are not perceived or managed as a strategic asset. Most staff in MAs are managed in traditional hierarchal settings where talent management is not perceived strategically for achieving the goals of ESIF investments. This often leads to some skills shortages or the misallocation of skills, a lack of formalisation around job profiles and roles, and poor anticipation of skills needs and workforce planning."},{"name": "https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/index.html#p-d1e643","text": "There is a widespread desire for more training, but learning and development modules lack a strategic vision and are under-utilised. Most MAs have training modules designed to keep staff up to date with legislative and regulatory developments.

Managing ESIF requires deploying a range of skills and technical knowledge, but many MAs lack the flexibility and agility to do so. MAs face competition in terms of attracting necessary skills, and existing human resource management policies are often rigid and slow. Opportunities for mobility is often limited, with many staff sitting in flat hierarchies with little chance of meaningful career progression. Over time, employee engagement can be affected, and in some MAs, turn-over is high."},{"name": "https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/index.html#p-d1e662","text": "MAs face common challenges in their strategic approach to Operational Programme implementation and the ESIF investment cycle, which affect spending effectiveness. Regardless of country contexts and degree of experience with ESIF financing, there is generally room to enhance capacity in strategic Operational Programme (OP) design, priority setting, information and knowledge sharing, and performance measurement. Doing so could help MAs better capture synergies within their OPs and across Priority Axes, create more integrated investment processes, optimise OP implementation processes throughout the investment cycle, and eventually enhance investment impact."},{"name": "https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/index.html#p-d1e668","text": "There is room to build stronger partnerships among Operational Programme stakeholders, particularly with beneficiaries, including through more customised approaches. MAs are fundamental partners in ensuring the effective use of ESIF as a means to attain Cohesion Policy and national development goals. Intermediate Bodies (IBs) and especially beneficiaries, as the final recipients of EU funds, play a decisive role in the ESIF investment process. There is room to better support the capacity of these two groups – and especially that of beneficiaries – to manage and undertake ESIF financed projects throughout the OP investment cycle. Tailoring communication and capacity-building to their needs is one approach. This additional consideration can be fundamental to establishing and maintaining constructive partnerships with OP stakeholders, particularly beneficiaries."},{"name": "https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/index.html#p-d1e681","text": "Framework conditions exert significant pressure on Operational Programme implementation, ultimately affecting absorption capacity. Framework conditions are generally outside an MA’s direct control, however, they strongly affect the capacity of MAs to smoothly manage OP investment. Frequent changes to regulatory and legal frameworks (both national and European-level), “one-size-fits all” approaches to OP implementation, inconsistent interpretations in control, verification and audit processes, and complex and/or opaque procurement laws all contribute to generating administrative burden and high transaction costs. This can result in implementation delays, financial corrections, mistrust in the system and, at an extreme, a disincentive among beneficiaries to use ESIF. MAs and other parties, including Intermediate Bodies (IBs), must work together to manage difficulties as quickly and efficiently as possible. It is also important to consider active consultation with MAs and IBs when designing the framework conditions that structure their work."},{"name": "https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/index.html#p-d1e694","text": "There is room for greater innovation in how MAs operate and in the practical implementation of Operational Programmes. The structures and processes framing ESIF management and implementation aim to minimise risk and mitigate potential fraud or error. This is highly reasonable. Meanwhile, the mechanisms established to accomplish this may be stifling the capacity of national and regional MAs to be innovative in diverse activities, including how they administer and manage their staff and organisations, and how they design and select projects. In turn, this may limit how effectively they can meet higher level objectives or their desired investment outcomes."},{"name": "https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/index.html#p-d1e700","text": "Initiatives to build the administrative capacity of MAs should be undertaken at the appropriate scale. There is a significant amount that MAs can do to build their capacity for more effective OP investment, particularly with respect to those matters that lie within their organisational mandate. There are other matters, however, that affect their ability to act and invest effectively, and overcoming these requires support from higher-level bodies. Human resources is an example. While MAs may be short-staffed and/or under-skilled, they often lack the authority and/or incentive to hire additional employees and train them to the extent necessary, due to regulations set centrally that apply to the broader public service. Furthermore, being heard on such matters as burdensome procedures, or inconsistent control results, and working to find practicable solutions cannot come from one MA alone, but must come from MAs as group. These then need to bubble up to the appropriate higher-level authorities for consideration and action. This type of unity and dialogue among MAs in a country does not seem to occur as often as it should or could. Finally, many of the actions found in the Roadmaps developed through this pilot could be better leveraged at a higher-level – through the Management and Control System or at National Coordination Body-level, for example. Doing so may have greater impact than taking an MA-by-MA approach. Actions could be easier to implement and have a broader impact on the administration and use of ESIF in a country, better supporting the ability of EU Member States to meet Cohesion Policy objectives."},{"name": "https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/index.html#p-d1e706","text": ""},{"name": "https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/1/2/1/index.html#chapter-d1e709","text": "Building administrative capacity for Cohesion Policy financingBuilding administrative capacity for Cohesion Policy financing"},{"name": "https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/1/2/1/index.html#p-d1e718","text": "This chapter provides an overview of European Structural and Investment Funds and Cohesion Policy in light of current trends in public investment.

Second, encouraging productivity growth is critical to ensuring greater well-being as it can have a positive impact on income and jobs, health, and access to services. One ingredient for promoting such growth is investment in both “hard” (e.g. transport, energy, Information and Communication Technology, etc.) and “soft” infrastructure (e.g. research and development, human capital and skills, social and community services, etc.), a focus of this current programming period.

This also holds true in the European Union. Of the EU 28 countries, public investment has declined since the 2008 crisis. There was a stabilisation between 2012 and 2016, but this was followed by a slight decline in 2015, which can be partially explained by fiscal consolidation, as well as the impact of ESIF. According to the European Investment Bank (EIB), in recent years and among countries that are heavily dependent on ESIF, these funds accounted for around two-fifths of public investment, or nearly 2% of GDP. This caused them to suffer from a “cliff effect” suddenly turning negative after the 2015 deadline for payments under the 2007-2013 programming period (EIB, 2016[9]). Entering the 2014-2020 programming period, and since 2017, public investment started to rise, as countries and regions implement ESIF investments (Figure 1.2).

This is equivalent to about USD 6.3 trillion per year in the next 15 years. To this should be added an additional USD 300 billion annually if climate concerns are taken into consideration (OECD, 2017[13]); and in the EU, a further EUR 100-150 billion will be needed between 2018 and 2030 to bridge an investment gap in social infrastructure (European Commission, 2018[14]). The sticking point, however, is that investment in global infrastructure currently amounts to about USD 2.5 trillion per year (McKinsey Global Institute, 2016[15]; Brookings Insitution, New Climate Economy, and Grantham Research Insitute, 2015[16]). In addition, investment in physical infrastructure alone is not enough to secure regional growth and development – it is only one of many contributing factors. It is just as important to ensure effective investment in “soft infrastructure” such as a robust business environment and appropriate human capital formation. Many, if not all, of these hard and soft infrastructure needs are captured in the EU’s 11 Thematic Objectives (investment priorities) for the 2014-2020 programming period (European Commission, n.d.[17])."},{"name": "https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/1/2/1/index.html#p-d1e1051","text": "A growing body of work points to the positive effects of public investment on growth, and OECD research shows that countries with higher levels of public investment increase their productivity faster than countries with lower levels of public investment (Fournier, 2016[18]).

The People dimension of this framework follows the second pillar of the PSLC which promotes civil service capacity to achieve operational and strategic objectives, in this case by identifying the mix of skills and competences needed in a high performing MA. It looks at how skills gaps are identified and addressed, both by attracting and recruiting the skills and expertise needed from the labour market, and by using learning and development tools, including training, to build workforce capacity. It also looks at how the workforce can be motivated to put its skills to best use. This suggests a review of incentives and performance management systems to set goals and measure their progress towards them, as well as the role of leaders and managers to motivate their employees."},{"name": "https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/1/2/1/index.html#p-d1e2632","text": "Women and men with the right skills also require an organisational structure and support that enable and empower them to put their skills to work. Recent empirical research shows that low organisational complexity and high personnel stability are important indicators of organisational capability (Andrews, Beynon and McDermott, 2015[57]). Employee actions are shaped to a large degree by the system in which they operate. This is the second level of analysis. This dimension looks at the systems, tools, business processes and culture that influence how staff of the MAs work. It looks at whether these tools and systems are aligned to the MA’s strategic objectives, and supported by agile governance structures to facilitate effective data-informed decision-making. HR systems bring in the right people and support them to contribute, and effective organisational development ensures people are able to deliver. ICT and information management systems are also essential, to facilitate communication and ensure that leadership is equipped to make data-informed decisions."},{"name": "https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/1/2/1/index.html#p-d1e2652","text": "The strategic planning dimension examines various aspects throughout the whole investment cycle, from strategy development, priority setting, coordination, project planning and selection, to project implementation, stakeholder engagement, and monitoring and evaluation. In a survey conducted by the OECD and Committee of the Regions (CoR) in 2015, poor strategic planning was identified one of the most important challenges for public investment, beyond the financing challenge (OECD-CoR, 2015[58]). The OECD Recommendation on Effective Public Investment across Levels of Government (OECD, 2014[29]) emphasises the pre-conditions for good strategic planning, in particular for the involvement of external stakeholders and private actors. The Principles also stress the importance of coordinating across levels of government, and across jurisdictions, as well as cross-sectoral coordination for effective investment strategies. The Recommendation, with 12 Principles, is complemented with an Implementation Toolkit that includes a set of indicators to help countries, regions, cities and other local authorities self-assess their strategic planning capacities, the bottlenecks they face, and the priorities for action (OECD, 2019[30])."},{"name": "https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/1/2/1/index.html#p-d1e2691","text": "Appropriate framework conditions are crucial for creating an enabling environment for all level of government to invest effectively.

Framework conditions determine the way the principle of partnerships work with the private sector (business community), non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and citizens. It is thus essential to take a holistic and comprehensive approach to understand clearly the bottlenecks hindering the effective and efficient functioning of the MA, and ways to address them. When doing so, the possibility of introducing some flexibility in the system, without changing the overall framework conditions, increases."},{"name": "https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/1/2/1/index.html#p-d1e2728","text": "[41] Allain-Dupré, D., C. Hulbert and M. Vincent (2017), “Subnational Infrastructure Investment in OECD Countries: Trends and Key Governance Levers”, OECD Regional Development Working Papers, No. 2017/05, OECD Publishing, Paris, https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/e9077df7-en."},{"name": "https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/1/2/1/index.html#p-d1e2747","text": "[57] Andrews, R., M. Beynon and A. McDermott (2015), Organisational Capability in the Public Sector: A Configurational Approach, http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jopart/muv005."},{"name": "https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/1/2/1/index.html#p-d1e2766","text": "[38] Bachtler, J. and I. McMaster (2008), “EU Cohesion Policy and the Role of the Regions: Investigating the Influence of Structural Funds in the New Member States”, Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy, Vol. 26/2, pp. 398-427, http://dx.doi.org/doi.org/10.1068/c0662."},{"name": "https://flamoitte.github.io/webbooks-test/1/2/1/index.html#p-d1e2785","text": "[49] Boijmans, P.
